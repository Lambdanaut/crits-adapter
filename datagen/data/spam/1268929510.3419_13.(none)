Attn !

With all due respect, please kindly confirm the receipt of this mail if you are in a position to represent our company in matters of delinquent accounts and coordination of delivery. We are contacting you in respect to representation of our company for we are of the opinion that you can represent us in order for us to recover monies due to our establishment owed by clients we've delivered goods to in your region.

After a careful review, it is logical to believe that you are capable and qualified in assisting my company with its financial services as well as work us through the modalities of setting up a subsidiary of our company in your region.

We specializes in exporting premium quality crystals, rough and uncut gemstones and mineral specimens from Fiji to America. Our goods has given rise to a significant increase in our customer base and due to our location and inability to process transactions effectively, we find our selves lacking in areas of remittance and for this we need your asistance to be able to work togerther as our representative in your region confirming transactions between us and clients.

From my business experience, I have come to realize that every good business reference starts with a satisfactory performance and I have decided that it is better for us to prove to ourselves how efficient we are. We also understand that a proper Attorney Client Retainership agreement will provide the necessary authorization and we are most inclined to commence talks as soon as possible I believe this is better than any recommendation or references.

Please also let us know what your remuration will be. Please accept my sincerest appreciation in advance for your willingness to render your services as we look forward to your prompt response to my email.

P.S. If you are not in the position to represent us we would be very glad if you could refer us to any that could. 

Once more thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read this mail.

Best Regards,
Mrs: Sikeli Waisea Viliami 
(Owner/MD)
