Sir, 

This is Mike Ndanusa, the new personal assistant to the DIRECTOR OF BUDGESTS IN THE PRESIDENTS OFFICE. If you are informed with happening s in Nigeria . You must have read that the National Assembly has just passed a SUPLIMENTARY BILL OF $350b for 2010 in Nigeria . Most of this money will not be spent at the end of the year. 

On this note, the Director of Budgets has directed me to get genuine business men who are doing good business so that he can use the businessman and his company to MOVE SOME HUGE AMOUNT LEGALLY by awarding a contract to the businessman, and inflate the cost by 500%. 

The Director of Budgets wants to know what your business is, where and how you operate, if you have legally constituted business in your country, and finally if your company have a good reputation with your bank. If you have these conditions, the Director of Budgets will award a contract to your company name depending on what you do, Issue you all the documents and inflate the contract, using that opportunity to transfer reasonable amount to your company depending on your company’s capacity. 

The contract will follow due process, legal documents will be issued and you will get the money in advance before we get some one here to execute the contract in your name. The over inflated amount will be shared 50/50 between you and the director of budgets. 

The Director suggested this means to avoid the money being viewed as MONEY LAUNDARING by Nigerian authorities and your country authorities. 

If you have a genuine business outfit and a good reputation with your bank. Please respond to me, let me take your case to the Director of Budgets so we can do business. 

Looking forward to your response. 

Micheal Ndanusa
