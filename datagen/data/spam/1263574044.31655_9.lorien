Attn: Please,
We wish to notify you again that you were listed as a Heir to the total sum of 
Ten Million British Pounds in the codicil and last testament 
of our deceased client. Name now withheld since this is our second letter to you. 

A regular mail was dispatched to you but yet no reply from you. We are contacting 
you again because her instruction stipulates that this fund should be paid directly 
to you upon her demise. 

We request you to kindly acknowledge officially, enabling us file all necessary legal 
documents to the paying bank for the urgent release of your inheritance. 

Please send an acknowledgement email and call to enable us process your inheritance. 

Yours Truly, 
Kelly David
Heir Trustees, South Wales UK.
