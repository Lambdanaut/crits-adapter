Dear honourable beneficiary,
 
PAYMENT NOTIFICATION OF YOUR FUNDS. 
 
Definitely, I am sure that the receipt of this email will be of utmost blessing to you.I am Mr.Simon Ben Davis the personal secretary to Prof. Sanusi Lamido Aminu, The New Executive Governor of The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).You are being officially contacted by me today because I was instructed to do so by my boss The New Executive Governor of The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), kindly note that your Funds were Re-deposited into the"Federal Suspense Account" of the CBN last week, because you did not forward your Claim as the Right beneficiary.
 
The Central Bank of Nigeria is the parent Bank of all commercial Banks here in Nigeria.My boss The Executive Governor of The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN),was visited in his office by three gentlemen last week, really these men were unexpected by him because their visit was imprompt. He had to ask them why they came to see him in person and they said that they came to collect the Inheritance/ contract funds Bill Sum of (US$20,000,000:00)$20 million which rightfully belongs to you, 
 
At this development He asked them who authorized them to come down to Nigeria for the Collection of this Payment and they told him that you asked them to come and collect these Funds on your Behalf. Infact this was the biggest shock that this Bank has ever received so far because your Inheritance Funds is still in the "Federal Suspense Account" of CBN,yet you sent these men to come and collect this Funds on your behalf without notifying us. We do not understand why you should send these men to come and Collect your Funds on your behalf. If actually you want them to help you collect your funds, 

you should have at least informed him officially as the Executive Governor of this Bank.Note that they actually tendered some Vital Documents which proved that you actually sent them for the Collection of these Funds. Honestly, it really shocked him that you took such a decision without his consent.Below is list of the Documents which they tendered to this Bank today. 
 
1. LETTER OF ADMINISTRATION.
2. HIGH COURT INJUCTION.
3. ORDER TO RELEASE. 
 
Actually, these Documents which they tendered to this Noble Bank are a clear Proof that you sent them to Collect this Funds for you. Finally,He, Prof Lamido told them to come back tomorrow morning and they promised to come back.As the Governor of this Noble Bank, he was supposed to Release this Funds to them but he refused to do so because he wanted to clarify this from you first. 
 
KINDLY DO GET BACK TO ME WITH YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER SO I CAN REACH YOU AS FAST AS POSSIBLE OK.
 
 Due to the Nature of his job, he cannot afford to make any mistake in releasing these Funds to anyone except you who is the Recognized Bonafide Beneficiary to these Funds.
 
Kindly clarify us on this issue before we make this Payment to these foreigners whom came on your behalf.Note that for security reasons you have been assigned a code/password which is {TT7270CBN},Please note that this code is the refernce number for your transfer and its being disclosed to you alone,guard this jealously and all your email response should carry this code as the subject.
 
Yours Faithfully,
Mr.Simon Ben Davis
