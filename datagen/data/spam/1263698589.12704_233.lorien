Attention:Beneficiary,

My name is Dr. Paul Udoka; I am the Director Foreign Funds
Payment Department Central Bank of Nigeria. I am delighted
to contact you directly for open confession and for you to
know the truth of the matter and the reason why you have not
received your overdue contract inheritance approved sum of
Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars Only ($12.5M)
up to this time. 

The truth is that your local partner or representative whom
claimed to have introduced you into this contract
inheritance payment came to my office some time ago as the
Director Foreign Funds Payment Department Central Bank of
Nigeria who is in charge of all foreign transfer and made an
agreement with me to assist him and transfer your $12.5M to
you and he will pay me compensation sum of $250,000 as soon
as you confirm your funds into your account. 

The agreement was signed between both of us without
legalizing it in the court and after I commenced on the
processing of the fund transfer in my Central Transfer Swift
Board ready for final transfer into your account, your local
partner decided to play over my intelligence by deciding to
abandon me and use a Cash Diplomatic System of payment
through this Bank to deliver your payment to you in your
country without my consent not knowing that the Cash
Diplomatic System Payment office Is under my department and
when I found out I stopped all the movement of the payment
and he went at my back to use ATM System of Payment to pay
you without knowing that it is under my department and I
stopped it again. Last week your local representative still
came back to my office to plead with me for a fresh
agreement to transfer the fund into your account again and
promise not to disappoint me again and he submitted the
below bank account details on your behalf for the transfer:

Bank Name: DEUTSCHE BANK TRUST COMPANY AMERICAS 
Bank Address: 300002, Russia Tula, Zarechensky area, street
Account Name: Edward Smith 
Account Number: 04410090 
Swift code: BKTR US 33 

When I looked into this account details I observed that the
name of the account holder is different from your own name
and I decided to contact you directly to know if you are the
true beneficiary of this account and also let you know the
simple reason why you have not received your payment up to
this time. Please kindly go through the above bank details
and confirm to me if the account is your correct bank
account details and get back to me immediately to avoid
paying to the wrong account. Feel free to call me on
234-01-2134355 as soon as you read this message before the
transfer will be effected. 

With Regards, 
Dr. Paul Udoka; 
Director Foreign Funds Payment Department. 
Central Bank of Nigeria.
