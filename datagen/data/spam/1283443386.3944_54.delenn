Thank you for contacting Mike Casey and Casey Design Group,

To help fight the battle against SPAM I have started using this simple filtering process to verify that you are a real person and not a SPAM creating e-mail program. 

Please click on this link once and you'll be approved and never have to do it again.

It doesn't add you to a mailing list or anything like that, it just makes sure you have hands and can click on a link. Spam programs can't click on anything.

Some people have been afraid to use this link, not sure that this e-mail it is from me. That shows why I need to use a filtering process! 

Until the government steps in to stop Spam, I have had to use something to stop the 500 Spam messages I receive per day.

Thank you and I truly apoligize for the inconvienience.

Mike Casey
