Dearly Beloved. 

I am a nationality of the United Kingdom, and I am presently hospitalized, due to my illness. I am 59 years old and I was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer for about two years. I am a widow to Late Mr. William Albert. My husband was once the Managing Director of Shell Oil Company in Malaysia, where we spent most of our lives and I have served the Lord all through my life. 
  
From all indications, my condition is serious and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe state and my doctor has told me this. The one that disturbs me most is the stroke that paralyzed half of my body before my late husband was killed during his reign as the Managing Director of Shell Oil Company,Malaysia 
  
My late husband was wealthy and after his death, I inherited all His businesses and wealth. Presently my doctor told me that I may not live for more than six months, though I am not scared about this, I am not afraid of death, So, I now decided to look for an organization or an individual that will use the funds for charity organization, assisting motherless babies homes and poor individuals. 
  
I selected you after searching the Internet for this purpose. I am willing to donate half of my husband's wealth to you for aids for the less privileged around you rather than allow my husbands relatives to use my husband hard earned funds unjustifiable. I need to make positive contribution to the upliftment of my fellow human beings. This I want to do through you. No matter the wealth one acquires while alive the most important things that counts in one's life is not how much money one make while alive but how much did one impact positively in the lives of fellow human beings. And I want you to bear this fact in mind. That is the true living. Endeavour to use this wealth as I want it to be used.

Ensure that you copy this correspondence to his email address above and tell him that I have asked you to reach him. Please, do not reply if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, you will have a reasonable percentage of the total funds before investing the remainder of the funds for God's works. Lastly, I want you and your church to keep praying for me regarding my health, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life, is vanity upon vanity. If you have to die says the Lord, keep fit and I will give you the crown of life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you now and forever more, amen. 
  
Good luck in all your future endeavors and God bless you. 
  
Thanks, 
  
Mrs. Victoria Albert
