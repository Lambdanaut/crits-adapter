Dear friend



I am Mr. Larry Williams, a director of claim working with a Diplomatic securities and finance company in South-East Asia.


Our company has assisted some of the world politicians in moving funds and valuables through our special diplomatic arrangements as deposit, some of these deposits where not claimed as results of deaths and some government restrictions, therefore are sent to our suspense warehouse.


Presently there are unclaimed ones about to be move to suspense warehouse, but I have perfected every arrangement to claim one of the consignments if I have a reliable and interested person to assist me. I was able to scan and confirm that it contains funds inside.


Please if you are truly interested and capable of handling this transaction contact me for more details. wmr.larry@yahoo.com.hk


Sincerely

Mr. Larry.
