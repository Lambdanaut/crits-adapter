Dear Sir/Madam

My name is (staff Sgt.) David Bruce; i am an American soldier, serving in the Military with the 
army's 3rd infantry division.

i have a very desperate need for Assistance and have summed up courage to contact you.
I found your contact through internet serching and I am seeking your kind Assistance to move the 
sum of Five million United States dollars (us$5,000,000) to you, as far as I can be assured that 
my share will be safe in your care Until i complete my service here.

Source of money: some money in US currencies were discovered in barrels at a Farmhouse near one 
of saddam’s old palaces in tikrit-iraq during a rescue operation, and it was agreed by staff Sgt
Kenneth buff and i that some part of this money be shared Between both of us before informing 
anybody about it sinceboth of us saw the money first.

This was quite an illegal thing to do, but i tell you what! no compensation can make up For the risk we have taken with our lives in this hell hole, of which my brother in-law Was killed by a road side bomb last time.

The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of money become a Problem 
for me but with the help of a British contact working here and with his office Enjoying some 
immunity, i was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely Out of trouble spot.


he does not know the real contents of the package, and he believes that it belongs to a British 
American medical doctor who died in a raid here in Iraq, And before giving up, trusted me to hand 
over the package to his family in country.

I have now found a very secured way of getting the package out of Iraq to you at home For you to 
pick up, and i will discuss this with you when i am sure that you are willing To assist me and 
that my money will be well secured in your hand.

I want you to tell me How much you will take from this money for the assistance you will give to 
me.

One Passionate appeal i will make to you is not to discuss this matter with anybody,if you have 
any reasons to reject this offer, please and please destroy this message as any Leakage of this 
information will be too bad for the u.s. soldier's here in Iraq.

I do Not know how long we will remain here; month of May was the deadliest month for us to be out 
Here. Totally, we lost many men and i have been shot,wounded and survived two suicide Bomb attacks by the special grace of GOD.

This and other reasons i will mention later Has prompted me to reach out for help.I honestly want 
this matter to be resolved immediately, please contact meas soon as Possible with my private 
e-mail address which is my only way of communication (e-mail: sgtdavidbruce2@yahoo.co.jp)
May god bless you and your family
From David Bruce
