Goodday TO You!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
I have been waiting for you since to contact me for your Confirmable Bank Draft of $850,000 United States Dollars, but I did not hear from you since for a couple of weeks now. Then I went to the bank to confirm if the draft has expired or getting near to the date of expire and Dr.Wilson the Director Bank of Africa told me that before the draft will get to your hand that it will expire.
 
So I told him to cash the $850,000 USD UNITED STATES DOLLARS to cash payment to avoid losing these funds under expiration as I will be out of the country for a 2 Months Course and I will not come back till ending of OCTOBER 2009. What you have to do now is to contact FedEx EXPRESS COURIER COMPANY as soon as possible to know when they will deliver your Consignment to you because of the expiring date. For your information I have paid for the delivering Charge, Insurance premium.
 
The only money you will send to the FedEx EXPRESS COURIER COMPANY to deliver your Consignment direct to your postal Address in your country is($190 .00 USD) One Hundred and ninety United States Dollars only being Security Keeping Fee of the Courier Company so far. Again, don't be deceived by anybody to pay any other money except $190.00 US Dollars.
 
I would have paid that but they said no because they don't know when you will contact them and in case of demurrage. You have to contact FedEx EXPRESS COURIER COMPANY now, for the delivery of your Draft with this information bellow;
 
1,Your Full Name:
2,Your Delivery Address:
3,Your Cell Phone Number:
4,Your Age:
5,Your Country:
6,Your OCUPATION:
7,Your Sex:
 
Directors Name: Mr. Johnson Brown.
 
Companies Name: FedEx EXPRESS COURIER COMPANY
 
EmailAddress:brown.ray355@gmail.com
 
Finally, make sure that you reconfirm your Postal address and Direct telephone number to them again to avoid any mistake on the Delivery and ask them to give you the tracking number to enable you track your package over there and know when it will get to your door step so that you can sign on it. Let me repeat again, Try to contact them as soon as you receive this mail and ask them how you will make the security fee of $190 to them to avoid any further delay and remember to pay them their Security Keeping fee of $190.00 US Dollars for their immediate
action.
 
Note this. The FedEx EXPRESS COURIER COMPANY doesn’t know the contents of the Box. I registered it as a BOX of Africa cloths. They did not know the contents were money. This is to avoid them
> delaying with the BOX. Don't let them know that box contents are money ok.

> You are to make this payment today via WESTERN UNION OR MONEY GRAM OUTLET in the name of our accounting officer:
