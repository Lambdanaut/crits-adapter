Attention,

Compliment of the day goes to you, how are you and your family? I have been
in search of someone with a kind heart not greedy a person that would help
me in this business till the end, so when I saw your e mail adress I was
pushed to contact you and see how best we can assist each other, i am the
Account manager of ,THE TRUST BANK GHANA{TTB,BANK}. I believe it is the wish 
of God for me to come across to you on search now. I am having an important
business discussion, I wish to share with you which and i believe it will
interest you because.

One Late anthony barnett, a citizen of your country had a fixed deposit with 
my bank in 2004 for 48 calendar months, valued at US$40mUS Dollars) the due
date for this deposit contract was this 16 of January 2008. Sadly anthony 
was among the death victims in the May 26 2006 Earthquake disaster in Jawa,
Indonesia that killed over 5,000 people.. He was in Indonesia on a business
trip and that was how he met his end.

My bank management is not aware of his death , I know about it because he
was my friend and I am his account officer.anthony barnett did not mention
any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, and he anthony was not
married and had no children. Last week my Bank Management requested that i 
should give instructions on what to do about his funds, if to renew the contract.

I know this will happen and that is why I have been looking for a means 
to handle the situation, because if my Bank Directors happens to know that
anthony barnett is dead and do not have any Heir, they will take the funds
for their personal use, so I don't want such to happen. That was why when I
saw your  name I was happy and I am now seeking your co-operation to
present you as Next of Kin/ Heir to the account, since you are a foreigner
 my bank head quarters will release the account to you.

There is no risk involved; the transaction will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, It is
better that we claim the money than to allowing the Bank Directors to take
it, they are rich already. I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we
share the funds equal, 50/50% to both parties, my share will assist me to
start my own company which has been my dream. Let me know your mind on this
and please do treat this information as TOP SECRET. We shall go over the
details once I receive your urgent response strictly through my personal
email address.  ( dr.victorkwamr@gmail.com )

Best Of Regard,
Dr Victor Kwame
