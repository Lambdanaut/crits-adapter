Kind Attention:</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I am sorry as this email may come to you as a surprise. This is following the sudden death of my husband. I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by my late husband's family members. I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture&nbsp; by them.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
My late husband intended to establish a business abroad with the sum of US$9,000,000.00 but unfortunately he died before this proposed venture. Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his property (Assets and money) since I am a woman and my only offspring is a little girl, as I do not have a male child for my husband, according to some barbaric traditional laws here in (Africa) which doesn't permit a woman to inherit a man's property, as they are expected by tradition to take over the management of his business and other properties including myself who automatically&nbsp; becomes a wife to one of his immediate brothers.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Unfortunately to these wicked family members, they do not know that my late husband deposited money with a Financial Institution unknown to his family members. I am the only one aware of this money, so I have discussed this matter with our family lawyer that I want this money personally so that I will be able to take care of my child's educational needs.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
According to our family lawyer, the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money to a bank account outside&nbsp; my country For&nbsp; safe-keeping, later I can then use it for business establishment. I therefore ask for your sincere assistance to facilitate the remittance of this fund from this bank. However, I have decided to give you (25%) of this fund&nbsp; as a reward for your sincere assistance, while 75% will be for me and my child. As soon as I get your positive response, I shall provide you with all the necessary detail for this transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I and my child can start all over again if only you wish.</DIV>
<DIV>
Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction. I will require your telephone and fax numbers so that we can commence communication&nbsp; immediately.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith, I can be reached on +2348050206153.</DIV>
<DIV>
Please expedite action.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Best Regards.</DIV>
