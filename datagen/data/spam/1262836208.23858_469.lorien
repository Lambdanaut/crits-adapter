Then I went to the bank to confirm if the draft has expired or getting near to the date of expiration and Dr.Wilson Junior' Director WEST AFRICAN INLAND BANK, told me that before the draft will get to you that it would have expired.



So I told him to cash the $2,000.000 Million UNITED STATES DOLLARS to cash payment to avoid losing this funds under expiration as I will be out of the country for a 4 Months Course and I will not come back till ending of May, 2010.
