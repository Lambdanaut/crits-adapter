 YOUR KIND ATTENTION

My name is zvi barak an executive member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland.Reference 

the website below for confirmation

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/volckmem.html

ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland, belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, 

which have remained dormant since World War II.

It may interest you to know that In January 13 2005,the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant 

accounts originally opened by non-Swiss  citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II 

(May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.

The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery 

of additional dormant accounts -2700 in  july, 2005.

The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts,securities 

accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody  accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts 

are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing
when established.

The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant 

account of NEUMANN ECKSTEIN with a credit balance of 11,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered 

by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of 

heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed money for permanent  closure of 

accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law 

for management of assets of  deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).

 Many people who have full records of their relatives bank details have successfully claimed their inheritance and 

paid in full. List of claimants who have been paid are listed on the website for  verification.

 Visit the website below to see the list of claimants who have been  paid:

 http://www.crt-ii.org/_awards/index.phtm

Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the money without any 

PROBLEM. The money will be banked in the  Carribean Islands, being a tax free, safe haven for money and we can share
the money and use in investment of our choice.


Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the money as the beneficiary.

All that is required is for you to provide me your details for processing of the necessary legal, and administrative 

claim documents for transfer of the money to you.

 Provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. The money will be  transferred to a secure account in  

your name ,because you will be acting as  the next of kin to the deceased person that can claim the money with claim 

documents in your name in the United Kingdom, and you can now start accessing the money gradually and transferring 

to your country and other banks of choice in the world. The banks in the UK have internet banking and telephone 

banking facility with electronic wire transfer feature through the internet and also anonymous ATM debit card. All 

these features mean additional security and convenience,so that you can stay in your country and access the money.

My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.

You can find additional information about unclaimed money through the internet at the following websites:

www.swissbankclaims.com



The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has allocated the money for payment to the beneficiary awaiting submission of 

valid claims for necessary disbursement.

I find myself priviledged to have this information and this is a great opportunity for a life time of success 

without risks.
