Dear Friend, 



I need your services in a confidential matter regarding consignment (fund) out of a family beneficiary deposit. This requires a private arrangement. 




You will receive these funds under legal claims; all legal documents will be carefully worked out to ensure a risk free transfer. 30% of the total sum would be your own potion at the end of this deal. 




I have all the details. The funds in question are quite large ($36.8M).I will expect a straight answer from you. If you are willing to assist,kindly furnish me with your personal information which must include your direct cell phone and fax number, your address and company name. 




Please get back to me through my private email:eloh2007z@gmail.com



Thanks as I expect to hear from you. 




Mr.Frank Eloh.
