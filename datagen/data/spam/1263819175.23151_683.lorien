Hello,

My name is TOM SEIDE. I am the Former Petroleum Product Adviser to
Wes/East Africa Countries. I have some fund to invest in your Company.

This fund arose from the sales of Crude Oil Block allocated to me while in
Office.

 If this offer interests you, quickly forward your Home and Cell
telephone numbers, your Company Name and Address to enable me process the
fund for immediate transfer to your Bank Account.

Best regards
Dr TOM SEIDE
