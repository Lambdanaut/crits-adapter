<P><font face="Verdana" size="2">This e-mail has been sent to you by BigPond to inform you that we were unable to process your most recent payment of bill. This might be due to either of the following reasons:
<br>				<br>
				1. A recent change in your personal information. (eg: billing address, phone)<br>
                                2. Submitting incorrect information during bill payment process.<br>
                                <br>
Due to this, to ensure that your service is not interrupted, we request you to confirm and update your billing information today
