Ay, they say." "Will you own the breaker, an' boss us boys?" came a
query from another quarter. Before Ralph could reply to this startling
and embarrassing question, some one else asked:-- "How'd you find out
who you was, anyway?" "Why, my lawyer told me," was the reply. "How'd he
find out?" "Well, a man told him." "What man?" "Now, look here,
fellows!" said Ralph, "I ain't goin' to tell you everything. It'd
predujuice my case too much. I can't do it, I got no right to." Then a
doubting Thomas arose. "I ain't got nothin' agin him," he began,
referring to Ralph, "he's a good enough feller--for a slate-picker, for
w'at I know; but that's all he is; he ain't a Burnham, no more'n I be,
if he was he wouldn't be a-workin' here in the dirt; it ain't

an' I want you boys to use me jest as well as ever you did, an' I'll
treat you jest the same as I al'ays have; now, ain't that fair?" "Yes,
that's fair!" shouted a dozen boys at a time. "Hooray for Ralph
Burnham!" added another; "hooray!" The cheers were given with a will,
then the breaker bell rang, and the boys flocked back to their work.
Ralph was as good as his word. Every morning he came and took his place
on the bench, and picked slate ten hours a day, just as the other boys
did; and though the subject of his coming prosperity was often discussed
among them, there was never again any malice or bitterness in the
discussion. But the days and weeks and months went by. The snows of
winter came, and the north winds howled furiously about the towerin
