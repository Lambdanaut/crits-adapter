Hello,I am Mrs Laura Morris, I am a US citizen, 58 years Old. I reside here in New Braunfels Texas,My residential address is as follows. 108 Crockett Court.Apt 303,New Braunfels Texas, United States,am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that had their Funds stuck in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me,to the extent that i had paid over $20,000 while in the USA,trying to get my payment all to no avail.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
So I decided to travel down to Ghana and Nigeria with all my Documents,And I was directed to meet MRS LAURA MORRIS,who is the member of PRESIDENTAIL PAYMENT COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained in details to me. </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
He further said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake and are Gimmicks.He took me to the paying Accreditted Government Agent ( Finance House ) for the claim of my long denied payment.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my funds of $3,800,000 Moreover,MRS LAURA MORRIS,showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries , and your email address,that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people who claims to be a Senior Officials amongs other Scammist names in Ghana they are not with your funds,they are only making money out of you.</DIV>
