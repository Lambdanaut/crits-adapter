HELLO,
HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY? HOPE YOU ALL ARE DOING ALRIGHT. MY NAME IS SGT.
CHRISTOPHER LEWIS AND I AM AN AMERICAN SOLDIER SERVING IN THE MILITARY OF
THE 3RD INFANTRY DIVISION IN IRAQ. AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE BEING ATTACKED BY
INSURGENTS EVERYDAY AND CAR BOMBINGS.

I HAVE SUMMED UP COURAGE TO CONTACT YOU WITH A VERY DESPERATE NEED FOR
ASSISTANCE. I FOUND YOUR CONTACT PARTICULARS IN AN ADDRESS JOURNAL. I AM
SEEKING YOUR KIND ASSISTANCE TO MOVE THE SUM OF ( $8 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS )
EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS TO YOU, AS FAR AS I CAN BE ASSURED THAT
MY SHARE WILL BE SAFE IN YOUR CARE UNTIL I COMPLETE MY SERVICE HERE.
 
SOURCE OF MONEY:
 
SOME MONEY IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES WAS DISCOVERED IN BARRELS AT A FARM HOUSE
NEAR ONE OF SADDAM'S OLD PALACES IN BAGHDAD -IRAQ DURING A RESCUE OPERATION,
AND IT WAS AGREED BY STAFF SGT KENNETH BUFF AND I THAT SOME PART OF THIS
MONEY BE SHARED AMONG BOTH OF US BEFORE INFORMING ANYBODY ABOUT IT SINCE
BOTH OF US SAW THE MONEY FIRST. THIS WAS QUITE AN ILLEGAL THING TO DO, BUT I
TELL YOU WHAT? NO COMPENSATION CAN MAKE UP FOR THE RISK WE HAVE TAKEN WITH
OUR LIVES IN THIS HELL HOLE. OF WHICH MY BROTHER IN-LAW WAS KILLED BY A ROAD
SIDE BOMB LAST TIME.  YOU CAN VIEW THE LINK ATTACHED TO THIS MAIL AND READ HOW
WE DISCOVERED THE MONEY: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2988455.stm
 
PLEASE I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR GENUINELY AND TRUSTWORTHY TO HANDLE THIS FUND
WITH UTMOST CARE WHEN YOU RECEIVED THE PACKAGE AND KEEP THE SECRET TO
YOURSELF ALONE AS YOU ARE AWARE THAT I AM STILL SERVING AS A SOLDIER, I
WOULD NOT WANT ANYTHING THAT WILL RUIN MY REPUTATION IN UNITED STATES
MILITARY RECORD. I WILL GIVE YOU 40% OF THE TOTAL MONEY FOR YOUR KINDNESS,
PLEASE IF THAT IS OKAY WITH YOU THEN LET ME KNOW ASAP.

 
I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG WE WILL REMAIN HERE AS WE WILL SOON MOVE TO
AFGHANISTAN, SO I WANT US TO CONCLUDE EVERY ARRANGEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
I HAVE BEEN SHOT, WOUNDED AND SURVIVED TWO SUICIDE BOMB ATTACKS BY THE
SPECIAL GRACE OF GOD, THIS AND OTHER REASONS I WILL MENTION LATER HAS
PROMPTED ME TO REACH OUT FOR HELP, I HONESTLY WANT THIS MATTER TO BE
RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY, PLEASE CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH MY E-MAIL
ADDRESS WHICH IS MY ONLY WAY OF COMMUNICATION. 
 
GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, IN GOD WE TRUST.
SGT. CHRISTOPHER LEWIS.
