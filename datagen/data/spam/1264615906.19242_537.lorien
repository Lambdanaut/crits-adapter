Hong Kong,


THIS IS FOR YOUR ATTENTION

I sincerely ask for forgiveness for I know this may seem like a complete 
intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my best option of 
communication. This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to 
ignore it as frivolous could come into your mind; but please consider it a 
divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility

This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before neither in 
person nor by correspondence,but I believe that it takes just one day to meet 
or know someone either physically or through correspondence.

I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as being quite

astute in private entrepreneurship,and one has no doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business transaction. I am Liu Yan a transfer supervisor 
operations in investment section in Bank of China Ltd. Secretariat of the BOCHK

Charitable Foundation 13/F. Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road,Hong Kong I have

an obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client

General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also business 
man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of (I 
will disclose amount upon your reply) in my branch.

Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war,again 
after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from 
him,We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim Ali and his family had been 
killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that General Mohammed Jassim

Ali did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper 
work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my

office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, (I will 
disclose amount upon your reply) is still lying in my bank and no one will ever

come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that, according to the laws 
of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership 
of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a 
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali so that 
you will be able to receive his funds.I want you to know that I have had 
everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. 

I have contacted an attorney who will prepare the legal documents that will 
back you up as the next of kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is 
required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names, 
private phone number and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. 
After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for 
claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate 
in your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be provided

by you with my guidance.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we 
are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the 
necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this 
issue. 
Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall 
discuss the percentage issue on your reply.

If you are interested please send me your full names and current residential 
address, and I will prefer you to reach me on my private and secure email 
address below and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of 
this operation.

Best Regards

Liu Yan
