My Dear,
 
It is my pleasure to let you know about my success in getting those fund transferred under the cooperation of a new partner.
 
I didn't forget your past efforts to assist me in transferring those funds which later failed. Now contact my lawyer in Ghana, he is Barr. Kwesi Nana by name, his email (kwesiasso@globomail.com) ask him to send you the total $2,500,000.00, which I raised for your compensation so feel free to get in touch with him.
 
Yours Faithfully
 
Lucky Robert
