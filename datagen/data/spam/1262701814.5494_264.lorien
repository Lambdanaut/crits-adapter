Hi,
How are you today?. My name is Mrs Sheila Bethram. I am working for OXFAM I=
NTERNATIONAL in Al Anbar, Iraq. Our main work is to establish adequate Educ=
ational institutions and health care centre in rural areas in Iraq, and als=
o we help internally displaced people locate their lost families=E2=80=A6et=
c.
Anyway, I got your address from a universal contact directory therefore I d=
ecided to write to you personal for an urgent discussion if you don`t mind.=
 I need your help urgently.=20
My main reason for writing to you is that I want to resign from my job due =
to the horrible situation which is taking place presently here in Iraq and =
there`s some funds about $2.7 million (TWO MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND U=
S
DOLLARS) which I want to move out of the country as quick as possible.
I want to know if you will be interested to help me secure this fund in you=
r country and keep it safe for me until I come and collect it back from you=
.
I think it`s reasonable for me to tell you honestly that this money is a pa=
rt of the fund allocated for implementation of Oil for Food Program in Iraq=
 and this program is directly co-ordinated by OXFAM INTERNATIONAL but unfor=
tunately some of Iraqi officials are apparently diverting some of this mone=
y to their personal accounts therefore I decided to take out this sum to he=
lp me take care of myself after my resignation.
Actually I do not know you in person that I should trust you enough though =
I believe that your response to this message will indicate your ability to =
handle this transaction. There is no risk involved because I will arrange h=
ow to move the fund to your country without any danger but my main concern =
is if you are really trustworthy. Can I trust you?.
I will offer you 15% of the total amount if you will accept to assist me in=
 this process and I would like you to suggest any profitable venture in whi=
ch I can invest my own share so that it will help me to overcome financial =
difficulty in the future.
Thank you very much and God bless you. I am looking forward to hearing from=
 you soon.

My warm regards with love and hugs.

truly yours
Sheila Bethram
