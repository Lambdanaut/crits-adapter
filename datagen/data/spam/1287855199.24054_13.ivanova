Hello, my friend!

True poets don't write their thoughts with a pen... They release the 
ink that flows from within their heart. I know, my honey, 
my dream, my hope, that the day when you enter my life, you will bring 
me much happiness and you will inspire the most romantic dreams 
imaginable www.lookingformylove.org  I look forward to spending time
with you and getting to know you. We will have many sunny, 
romantic days to look forward to together.

All the best
Tanya V
