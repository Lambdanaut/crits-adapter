Dear one

I am optimistic to request for your consent in a mutual international business relationship between you and I. My name is Mr. Paul Frank from Republic Of Ghana;

I got your contact from the web while searching for investment opportunity. I am a civil servant who realized $6.5 million through the sale of our allocated oil quota in OPEC from commission payouts through out my tenure as the Head of Delegation to the World Bank in West Africa.
 I want you to assist me in investing this fund in real estate and commercial properties or any other profitable venture you are familiar with since as a civil servant I cannot have such funds and the code of conduct bureau forbids me to acquire such amount of money. Upon your consent to this request I will send my proposal and we will discuss in details.
 I will equally like to procure the change of ownership or statutory declaration for fund legalization from the law court making you the original beneficiary of the fund, which I will send to you. Thank you for giving me your time, am hoping for a friendly response.

Regards,

Paul Frank
