Sorry for contacting you this way, I got your email online searching for a good home that will adopt my English Bulldog “Presley”. Actually I have not be able to contact you, due to the terrible situation I have been through, my dearest husband had a terrible car accident and has been in coma for some months now, and this was the main reason I needed a good home for Presley so I could be able to concentrate with the care of my husband. Few weeks ago I finally lost my dear husband, and now I have to contact you to know if you are still interested in adoption my little Presley cos I need to give him a good home so i could move on with my life. Presley is just a fabulous and exquisite English bulldog with lots of baby bullies wrinkles!,stocky with short legs,heavy bone,awesome mass and wide chest,excellent temperament,with a lifetime of love and wrinkles. He is very current on his vaccinations and de-worming and will come with full AKC registration for show or responsible breed!
 ing. Pls do get back to me via sna
