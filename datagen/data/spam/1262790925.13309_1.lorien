Complement of the day,

We received an international communique to pay you $5.5 Million through diplomatic courier.

For reference purpose, and for security purpose, the code to open the consignments upon their arrival is  (3#gzq00k ). (For the Big Trunk Box), and  (#9koq0z1) for the smaller Trunk Box.

These are 8 digit code which you will need to open the consignment. When the package arrives, you should only make 3 attempts at logging the security codes to open it, as a 4th attempt would permanently lock the box until we re-generate another code to reopen it, you should try as much as possible to avoid error while entering the code so that it will not DENY your access.

Attached herein is the picture of the box containing the total sum of $5.5 Million Dollars. The big box contains $3
Million, while the small box contains $2.5 Million dollars respectively.

Please, take a look at the picture, and get back to me so that we can further talk about the cost of shipping since my personal efforts to ensure that you personally do not pay this has been dashed with the stringent Shipping policy, and i can not afford to compromise such. Besides, it would result into a gross abuse of office if i do so.

I await your email so that i can forward you with the payment details for receiving the shipping fees in order to finally proceed with the shipment.

Happy New Year!!!

I remain,

Dr. Anderson King.
