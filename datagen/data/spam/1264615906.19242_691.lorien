Kind Attention Required. 


I hereby write to  enquire in confidence, That we can jointly do some 
genuine and legal stock transfer trading together based on a Joint Venture. 

I have an operative international certified acceptable Medium Term
Note Stock (Program) le, which I was thinking I could work with you to reassign the account to your name, and I assume as so said of you to be powerful in the financial, that after the reassignment, the amount would be transferred to your bank account. 


The principal amount of the POF is US$100 Million, and I have already worked out modalities to execute the transfer successfully; hence I ask of you to confirm ASAP whether or not you are interested. 

The BOE is an irrevocable Bank Operative Instrument, which you can
use as collateral to bank against a loan immediately we fully reassign to you, which means your bank can even borrow against it. I shall send you evidence of funds which once can still through bank-to-bank confirm Existence. 


I would appreciate that you get back to me upon receipt of this 
important mail on your opinion towards a lasting business relationship 


Respectfully, 


Mr khoza.
