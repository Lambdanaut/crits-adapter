Attn/From Department Of Defense.

Dear Friend,

How are you today?This Letter might come to you as a surprise. I am Capt. Joe Bourland From Washington, DC. And also a West Point Graduate,

 I am an American soldier in peace keeping force here in Iraq,

I am serving in the military of the 1st Armored Division in Iraq, after going through your profiles yours capture my interest as i strongly believe you are in better position to assist in this matter very well.

As you know insurgents everyday and car bombs are attacking us. We managed to move funds belonging to Saddam Husein's family in the tune of USD$ 45 Million Dollars in cash.

This fund itself was discovered some years ago and we have hidden and concealed the funds waiting for an opportunity to move the funds out.Now there will be no more time. All U S troops are leaving Iraq most of us have been redeployed to Afghanistan.We have to move the funds now or we could loose everything.

Iâ€™m contacting you as an external body because of our status as American soldiers on war duty. Our activities are highly limited based on the U.S military code of conduct.

We want to move this money to you now, so that you will keep our share for us till when we will come over to meet you. You are to take 30% of the total 45 Million Dollars and keep 70% for me and my partners.

Please No strings attached, we plan on using diplomatic courier and shipping the money out of Iraq in three  silver boxes using diplomatic immunity. The boxes can be shipped out in 48hrs it is risk free because it is well arrange,

So If you are interested kindly send an e-mail signifying your interest including your most confidential telephone numbers for quick communication this is necessary in the interest and the protection of our partnership,

Then we can send to you the shipment details and the fright number and labels it is 100% risk free. Please contact immediately for more information.

LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR MAIL.

Yours Sincerely

Capt Joe Bourland,
