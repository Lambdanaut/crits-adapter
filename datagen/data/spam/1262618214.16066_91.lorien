Compliment Of The Day!

It is understandable that you might be a little bit apprehensive=20
because you do not know me but I have a lucrative business=20
proposal of mutual benefits to share with you.

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Hong Wu operations=20
manager of the Bank of China (Shanghai Branch), 200 Mid.=20
Yincheng Rd., Pudong New District, Shanghai 200121, China. I=20
have an obscured Business suggestion for you.

In June, 2002, a certain British Crude oil merchant (Mr.Martin=20
Walker) came to our bank and made a Fixed (Numbered) deposit of=20
Thirty Million United State Dollars (US$30,000,000.00) Only in=20
my branch for 12 calender months. Upon maturity, I sent a=20
routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.=20
A month later, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from=20
his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation=20
that he died from an automobile accident. On further=20
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL,=20
and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

After proper further investigations, it was also discovered that=20
he did not declare any next of kin in his official papers=20
including the paper work of his bank deposit and he also=20
confided in me the last time he was in my office that no one=20
except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Thirty Million=20
United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will=20
ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that=20
according to Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of=20
seven {7} years the funds will revert to the ownership of the=20
Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. What I=20
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I=20
want you to understand something, It is only an outsider to the=20
banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking=20
world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is=20
fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices=20
and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to=20
put together the general direction of what I am proposing.

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like=20
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin so that you will=20
be able to receive the funds so that the fruits of this old=20
man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt=20
government officials just like that.

MODALITIES:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so=20
that we shall come out successful. I shall employ the services=20
of an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that=20
will back you up as the next of kin, and also he will be=20
drafting and tarization the WILL and to obtain the necessary=20
documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for=20
the transfer. There is a reward for this project and it is a=20
task well worth undertaking. There is no risk involved at all in=20
this transaction as all the paperwork for this transaction will=20
be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager=20
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is for=20
you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only=20
one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you=20
with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in=20
my life. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all=20
matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been=20
transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the=20
ratio of 50% for me, and 50% for you. I send you this mail not=20
without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I=20
know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that=20
success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.=20
Please observe this instruction religiously.

And I will prefer you reach me on my private email address:=20
hong72234@yahoo.com.hk and finally after that I shall furnish you=20
with more information=E2=80=99s about this operation. Your earliest=20
response to this letter will be appreciated.=20

Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we=20
should plan a meeting soon after this project is successful.=20
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that=20
this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because=20
I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your=20
country.

Kind Regards,

Hong Wu.
