<B><I>I am a South African married to a Sierra Leonia. I was the President/CEO of CON OIL INTERNATIONAL-an oil servicing company in Johannesburg. I was also married with no child. My husband died on the 24th&nbsp; of&nbsp; November 2004.</B></I></DIV>

<DIV>
<B><I>Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I was living for and I never really cared about other people. But since the loss of my Husband and also because i had have no child to call my own, I have found a new desire to assist the helpless, I have been helping orphans in orphanages/motherless homes/humanitarians. I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. IN SUMMARY:- I have 18,000,000.00 (Eighteen Million) U. S. Dollars which I deposited in a security company in Cotonou Benin republic as a family treasure &amp; artefacts, please I want you to note that the security company does not know the real content to be money and I want you to assist me in claiming the consignment &amp; distributing the money to charity organizations, I agree to reward you with part of the money for your assistance, kindness and participation in this Godly project.Before I became ill, I kept $18 M
 illion in a long-term deposit in

<DIV>
<B><I>I am in the hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations. Because my relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the $18 Million which I deposit with the name of my late husband as the next of kin because now due to my health the security company is demanding for a next of kin in other to get the money transferred in other to see that my last wish is accomplished which is sharing the money among charity organizations.</B></I></DIV>
