Attn: Ceo

Good day,

 My name is Mr. Andy  Amtan, I am a senior partner in the firm of Infinity Consultants "Private Investigators and Security Consultants" here in London Uk. We are conducting a standard process investigation on behalf of "HSBC", the International Banking conglomerate.

 This investigation involves a client who shares the same surname with you  and also the circumstances surrounding investments made by this client at "HSBC",the Private Banking arm of HSBC. The HSBC Private Banking client died  and nominated no successor in title over the investments made with the bank. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail private and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.

 You share similar details to the late and I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation.

Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds with you, I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal.

There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the centre of relevance in my life. Lets share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through my email.

Below. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion and give more details regarding the transaction woill be sent to you.

Best regards,
Mr. Andy  Amtan,
