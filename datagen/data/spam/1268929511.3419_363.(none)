Greetings,
I am Mr.Tsai-Yuan Lin, Director of Operations and Head Wealth Management Division of Taiwan Business Bank (TBB) Taipei, Taiwan. In our current performance of Annual Account Audit, our auditors found within our database some couple of accounts with huge deposits that has no registered name or next of kin associated with its record. As the man in the helm of affairs, these files were sent to my office for endorsement so that the deposits are transferred to the Taiwan Government Treasury and Reserve Accounts as unclaimed deposits. I did endorsed all but leaving one behind which I am very much familiar with; I indicated that the one I left has a next of kin/beneficiary associated with it but in the real sense, it has no beneficiary and this account is worth $18,000,000.00 (Eighteen Million US Dollars).

Being in the helm of affairs, I have the power and expertise to have these funds moved but there has to be a recipient who must be a foreigner. I therefore seek your consent to collaborate with me by allowing me document you (through an attorney here) as the next of kin/beneficiary in position to receive the $18M USD, then you and I will share the money. Should you be interested in working with me on this, do indicate your interest by sending me your full names, phone number and current residential address. I would prefer you reach me via my personal email address:
 
Email: lin_tsai_yuan01@yahoo.com.hk
 
Once I hear from you, I immediately will provide you with further information on logistics of having these funds moved.

Sincerely,
Mr.Tsai-Yuan Lin
