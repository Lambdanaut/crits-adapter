<FONT size=4 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"><B><I>We will divide the total funds in three ways, since we are 3 that are involved. This means that you will take 20%, I will take 40%, and my superior will take 40%. This business is confidential, and it should not be discussed with anyone. There is no risk involved whatsoever. If you are interested I will send you the full details, my job is to find a good partner that we can trust and that will assist us. REPLY URGENTLY so we can furnish you with the details of the fund. Hope to hear from you soon. </B></I></FONT></DIV>
