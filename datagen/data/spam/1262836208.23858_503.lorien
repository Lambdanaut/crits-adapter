FROM THE DESK OF
BARRISTER ARKTAR BIN RAZAK
ARKTAR BIN RAZAK LAW CHAMBERS SOLICITOR & ADVOCATE
KUALA LUMPUR MALAYSIA.
E-mail: barriste_arktar_bin@neu.com.cn
 
Good day,
                                      
 
My name is Barrister Arktar Bin Razak, an attorney at law chambers of Arktar Bin Razak Chamber Solicitor & Advocate in Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia .
 
A deceased client of mine whose name is the same last name with you, who herein after shall be referred to as my client, died together with his family on December 26 -2004 as a result of Tsunami Disaster. I am contacting you because you have the same surname as my deceased client and I felt that you could help me in the distribution of funding that were left in my deceased client's bank account. This funding is closed to be declared UN-serviceable by the bank as there were no indicated next of kin or next of beneficiary of the funding in the bank account.
 
The total amount of cash in the bank account of my deceased client is US$8.4 Million (Eight Million Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollar) only. The bank had issued to me a notification to contact the next of kin of my deceased client or the account will be confiscated.
 
My proposition to you is to seek your consent, and to present your kind self as the next-of-kin and beneficiary of my deceased client, since you have the same last name with him. This means that the proceeds of his bank account would be paid to you as his next of kin or the legitimate beneficiary. We would share the percentage on a mutually agreed-upon 60% for me and 40% to your kind self.
 
All the legal documents to back up the claim as my client's next-of-kin would be provided by me. This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that would protect you from any breach of the law.
 
If this business proposition offends your moral and ethic values, do accept my sincere apology. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinary confidential, whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.

Please response to my private email (barriste_arktar_bin@neu.com.cn )
 

Best regards,
Barrister Arktar Bin Razak {Esq}
