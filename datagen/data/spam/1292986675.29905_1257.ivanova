Dear Friend,

I am Mark Tunde, a fund manager with Zenith Financial Group, a contractor and an investor who a customer is named Mr. Alfred Perrot, made a deposit valued at us$25,500,000.00. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After three months we discovered from his contract employers that the depositor had died. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a will.

however, my proposal is to front you as the beneficiary to the deceased customer of our bank, if this transaction interests you kindly let me know so I can advice you on how we are going to execute this deal and the total sum of us$25,500,000.00 will be paid and transfer to you by our bank on our behalf.

I completely trust you to keep this proposition absolutely confidential and kindly forward your full names, contact address, telephone and fax numbers where I can reach you easily. I have suggested that we share the funds as follows 60% for me 40% for your effort , I look forward to your earliest response through my alternative email address below: (mrmarktunde@hosanna.net) For security reasons.


Best regards,

Mr. Mark Tunde
