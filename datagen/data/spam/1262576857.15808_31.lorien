  <br /> This Information will Protect You:
  <br />
  <br /> In CB-United we feel it's important to help other people
  <br /> gain awareness in all avenues of life, for this reason let me
  <br /> forward some very helpful lines about identity theft right here:
  <br />
  <br /> A close friend of mine has a corporate attorney
  <br /> friend who sent the following out to the employees in
  <br /> his company.
  <br />
  <br /> It's worth reading and doing.
  <br />
  <br /> 1. The next time you order checks have only your
  <br /> initials (instead of first name) and last name put on
  <br /> them. If someone takes your checkbook, they will not
  <br /> know if you sign your checks with just your initials or
  <br /> your first name, but your bank will know how you sign
  <br /> your checks.
  <br />
  <br /> 2. Do not sign the back of your credit cards.
  <br /> Instead, put "PHOTO ID REQUIRED."
  <br />
  <br /> 3. When you are writing checks to pay on your credit
  <br /> card accounts, DO NOT put the complete account number
  <br /> on the "For" line. Instead, just put the last four
  <br /> numbers. The credit card company knows the rest of the
  <br /> number, and anyone who might be handling your check as
  <br /> it passes through all the check-processing channels
  <br /> will not have access to it.
  <br />
  <br /> 4. Put your work phone # on your checks instead of your
  <br /> home phone. If you have a PO Box, use that instead of
  <br /> your home address. If you do not have a PO Box, use
  <br /> your work address. Never have your SS# printed on your
  <br /> checks, (DUH!). You can add it if it is necessary.
  <br /> However, if you have it printed, anyone can get it.
  <br />
  <br /> 5. Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy
  <br /> machine. Do both sides of each license, credit card,
  <br /> etc. You will know what you had in your wallet and all
  <br /> of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and
  <br /> cancel. Keep the photocopy in a safe place. Also carry
  <br /> a photocopy of your passport when traveling either here
  <br /> or abroad. We have all heard horror stories about fraud
  <br /> that is committed on us in stealing a name, address,
  <br /> Social Security number, credit cards.
  <br />
  <br /> 6. When you check out of a hotel that uses cards for
  <br /> keys (and they all seem to do that now), do not turn
  <br /> the "keys" in. Take them with you and destroy them.
  <br /> Those little cards have on them all of the information
  <br /> you gave the hotel, including address and credit card
  <br /> numbers and expiration dates. Someone with a card
  <br /> reader, or employee of the hotel, can access all that
  <br /> information with no problem whatsoever.
  <br />
  <br /> Unfortunately, as an attorney, I have first hand
  <br /> knowledge because my wallet was stolen last month.
  <br /> Within a week, the thieve(s) ordered an expensive
  <br /> monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit
  <br /> card, had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway
  <br /> computer and received a PIN number from DMV to change
  <br /> my driving record information online. Here is some
  <br /> critical information to limit the damage in case this
  <br /> happens to you or someone you know:
  <br />
  <br /> 1. We have been told we should cancel our credit cards
  <br /> immediately. The key is having the toll free numbers
  <br /> and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call.
  <br /> Keep those where you can find them.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br /> 2. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction
  <br /> where your credit cards, etc., were stolen. This proves
  <br /> to credit providers you were diligent, and this is a
  <br /> first step toward an investigation (if there ever is
  <br /> one). However, here is what is perhaps most important
  <br /> of all (I never even thought to do this.)
  <br />
  <br /> 3. Call the three national credit reporting
  <br /> organizations immediately to place a fraud alert on
  <br /> your name and Social Security number. I had never heard
  <br /> of doing that until advised by a bank that called to
  <br /> tell me an application for credit was made over the
  <br /> Internet in my name. The alert means any company that
  <br /> checks your credit knows your information was stolen,
  <br /> and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new
  <br /> credit. By the time I was advised to do this, almost
  <br /> two weeks after the theft, all the damage had been
  <br /> done. There are records of all the credit checks
  <br /> initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I
  <br /> knew about before placing the alert. Since then, no
  <br /> additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw
  <br /> my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It
  <br /> seems to have stopped them dead in their tracks.
  <br />
  <br /> Now, here are the numbers you always need to contact
  <br /> about your wallet and contents being stolen:
  <br />
  <br /> 1.) Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
  <br /> 2.) Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
  <br /> 3.) TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289
  <br /> 4.) Social Security Administration (fraud line):
  <br /> 1-800-269-0271
  <br />
  <br /> We pass along jokes on the Internet; we pass along just
  <br /> about everything. So don't stop now. Pass this on!
  <br />
