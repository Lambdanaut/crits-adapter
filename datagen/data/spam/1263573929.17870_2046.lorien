Hi,

January is a month of New Year's Resolutions, and what better 
resolution is there than to get your business SEO Fit? Just as 
getting physically fit means more exercise and a better diet, 
getting SEO Fit for Google, Yahoo, and Bing means more time 
identifying your best keywords, more time worrying about page 
tags, and more time building links ...

My upcoming free online webinars (early Feb.) introduce you to the 
top 10 free SEO tools - tools that can help you in your 
Search Optimization Strategy.  You take it from the convenience 
of your own computer via the Webinar software.  It's easy, fun, 
and informative!

Search engine optimization involves three steps:

* identifying the keyword searches your customers are making
* using free tools to refine that information into your on-page 
  and off-page SEO strategies
* implementing these on your own website

Topics covered in the free SEO Tools webinar and my upcoming full 
7-session course (which does require payment) include:

 * Page Tags - HTML Tags that Google Search Engines Prefer
 * Rank - determining your Google rank and that of competitors
 * Keywords - the key terms and phrases you should have
 * Website structure - the best website structure for search
 * Metrics - Google analytics and Webmaster tools
 * News - how to use news to rise to the top of searches
 * Link-building - Tools to identify link targets


You may choose not to continue with the paid training; even so I am 
sure you will find the one-hour class well worth it.

Hope to see you there.  It will be time well spent!

Best regards,

J. McDonald
