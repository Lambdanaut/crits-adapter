Hello people,

In shipping or handling Heavy-lift & Project cargoes there is no room for
the 'Rule of Thumb'. You can't assume or guess, you need to know for sure.


If you are a Charterer, Shipper, Shipping Line, Cargo-Superintendent or
Surveyor, you want to be sure that your shipment, is being delivered in a
safe and sound way, like stated in the terms of agreement. Visual Cargo Care
empowers you with the maximum grip on the most complex and riscy projects.

The safety and economical risks of incorrect and incomplete securing of your
cargoes are being underestimated in practice. Visual Cargo Care insures with
solid guaranty that the cargo is secured according to the highest
international standards.


Convince yourself and click
<http://www.visualcargocare.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id
=98&Itemid=98> here, to view our website and subscribe to our newsletter. It
takes you only a few minutes to get a better grip on your next load-out.

Visual Cargo Care.. the new standard in Lashing & Securing.
