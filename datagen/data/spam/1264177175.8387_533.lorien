<DIV>
My name is Mr. Frank Mensah. I am the manager of the international commercial bank Ghana, first light branch. I am a Ghanaian </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
married with two kids. I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of four million five hundred </DIV>
<DIV>
thousand dolars usD$4.500.000.00 This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager </DIV>
<DIV>
made as profit during the last year. </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I have already submitted an approved end of the year report for the </DIV>
<DIV>
year 2009 to my head office here in Accra and they will never know of this excess.</DIV>
<DIV>
 I have since then, placed this amount of&nbsp; (usD$4.500.000.00 } on a suspense account without a </DIV>
<DIV>
beneficiary. As an officer of the bank, </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am impelled </DIV>
<DIV>
to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account. I intend to part 40% of </DIV>
<DIV>
this fund to you while 60% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk </DIV>
<DIV>
involved in this. Its going to be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the </DIV>
<DIV>
original depositor of this fund. I will appreciate your timely response.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
With Regards,</DIV>
<DIV>
