<FONT size=4 face="Georgia"><I>Breaking News! Prof. Charles C. Soludo has been arrested by the Economic &amp; Financial Crime Commission (E.F.C.C) for destroying the lives of innocent people who called for the release of their contract payment and inheritance beneficiaries. He has scammed not less than 2 million people claiming to release their funds and was requesting for illegal fees such as delivery fee and documentation fees.&nbsp; Shortly after his interrogation with the men of the E.F.C.C, he will be charged to court and the law will take its cause.</I></FONT></DIV>

I have cross checked the unattended files sent to my desk and the records of outstanding contractors due for payment, with the federal government of Nigeria shown that you have not received your funds. The amount recorded as your contract payment/ inheritance is $19.5 Million US Dollars and that has been corrected from what other offices told you.</I></FONT></DIV>

I can not vividly explain how this payment was generated or occurred to you, but i was informed before I resumed my humble office in the month of&nbsp; December&nbsp; 2009 to pay the list of beneficiaries whose names are contained in this quarter payment schedule. As instruction from the presidency I cannot argue it coupled with the fact that the computer departments of the central bank was burnt down some months back before I resumed this humble office, and all available information as regards to your details that was dropped by the foreign contractor was omitted or partially missing as well.</I></FONT></DIV>
