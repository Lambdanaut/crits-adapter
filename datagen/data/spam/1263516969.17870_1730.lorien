Dear Beloved in Christ,

It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,having known the 
truth,I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right 
in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for 
witness of God & his mercies and glory upon my life.

I am Mrs.Sheila Johnson the wife of Mr Harold Johnson,my husband worked 
with the Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty 
years before he died in the year 2001.We were married for ten years 
without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that 
lasted for only four days.

Before his death we were both born again Christians.
Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my 
matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late 
husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$3.5M.(Three Million Five 
Hundred Thousand U.S.Dollars) with a Bank in Asia.

Presently,this money is still with the Bank and the management just 
wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the 
release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to 
somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.
Presently,I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing 
treatment for esophageal cancer.I have since lost my ability 
to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to 
live.It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity 
organizations anywhere in the World.Because relatives and friends have 
plundered so much of my wealth since my illness,I 
cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to 
any of them.
 
Please,I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand and collect the 
Funds from the Bank.

I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund 
churches,orphanages and widows propagating the word of 
God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I 
took this decision because I don't have any child that will 
inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I 
don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused 
by unbelievers.I don't want a situation where this money will be used 
in an ungodly manner.Hence the reason for taking this bold 
decision.I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I know 
that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.

Exodus{14 VS 14}says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold 
my peace.I don't need any telephone communication in this 
regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's 
relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about 
this development. With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of my 
attorney who is in Asia as he will be the one to assist you in laying 
claims for this funds.

Kindly send your reply to my private email address which is as follows:

Your Sister in Christ,
Mrs.sheila Johnson.
