From Mr. Bright Asamoah

The Manager, International
Commercial Bank Ghana
First Light Branch
Accra , Ghana

Hello,


Pardon me for not having the pleasure of knowing your mindset before making you this offer and it is utterly confidential and genuine by virtue of its nature. I am Mr. Bright Asamoah the branch manager of the international Commercial Bank, Kaneshie First Light Branch Accra Ghana . I write to solicit your assistance in a funds transfer deal involving US$ 2.3m

This fund has been stashed out of the excess profit made last year by my branch office of the International Commercial Bank of Ghana which I am the manager. I have already submitted an approved end-of-the-year report for the year 2008 to my head office here in Accra-Ghana and they will never know of this excess. I have since then, placed this amount on a Non-Investment Account without a beneficiary.

Upon your response, I will configure your name on our database as holder of the Non-Investment Account. I will then guide you on how to apply to my head office for the Account Closure/ bank-to-bank remittance of the funds to your designated bank account.

If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 30% of the funds while 70% shall be for me. Your earliest response would be appreciated on the regards.

Sincerely,

Mr. Bright Asamoah
