I am Michael Wang Lee, Principal Assurance manager for the China Trust Commercial Bank,China. I am 
getting in touch  with you regarding the estate of a deceased client, and an investment placed under our 
banks management 9 years ago.

I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of
 the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contact you independently and no one is informed of 
this communication. In 2000, the subject matter; Alfred Abbott came to our bank to engage in business 
discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of Eighteen
Million, Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars, which he wished to have us invest on his
behalf.

Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our
first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at over Two Million. In mid 2002, he
instructed that the principal sum Eighteen Million, Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars, 
be l iquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Hong Kong. 
We got in touch with the Kincheng Banking Corporation which is a specialist bank in China,and has now
been merged with the Bank of China, with a foreign representative branch in Hong Kong who agreed to
receive this money for a fee and make cash available to Alfred. 

However, Bank of China got in touch with us last year that this money has not been claimed. On further 
enquiries we found out that Alfred was involved in an accident in Mainland China,which means he died
interstate. On further investigation we found out that Late Alfred left behind no next of kin and this is the 
reason I am writing you.

What I propose is that since I have exclusive access to his file, and I can make you the beneficiary of 
these funds. My bank will contact you informing you that money has been willed to you. On verification, 
which will be the details I make available to my bank, my bank will instruct Bank of China to make 
payments to you. You do not have to have known him. I know this might be a bit heavy for you but 
please trust me on this. For your assistance I propose that we split the money in half.  In the banking circle 
this happens every time. The other option is that the money will revert back to the state.

Nobody is getting hurt; this is a lifetime opportunity for us. I hold the KEY to these funds, and as a Chinese 
National we see so much cash and funds being re-assigned daily. I would want us to keep communication 
for now strictly by email, as time goes on I shall furnish you with my telephone number, so you can also 
reach me by phone. My spoken english is not too good, but you should be able to understand me.

Please, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a 
measure of fear as to the consequences, because I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained
and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned
from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should act 
swiftly on this. Please if you accept my proposal respond back to me immediately via the above email.

I await your positive response. 

Michael Wang Lee
