Good Day,
 
I am a Barrister, my name Morris Coleman, a solicitor & Notaries law. I'm contacted you in respect of a dormant account which amounts to GBP 11 Million, 3 Hundred Thousand Pounds belonging to my late client who shares similar surnames with you.

 
I was given an ultimatum from the Bank to provide a member of his family and all efforts to locate any has been proven Unsuccessful.


I want to present you as a surviving family member to enable you put a claim to the funds. Please indicate your interest for more information by responding to my private Email account: lawyer-morris-coleman@hotmail.com

 
Thanks,


Yours Truly,


Mr. Morris Coleman.
