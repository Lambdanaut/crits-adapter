Dear Sir/Madam

The International Settlement department of Bank of England is obligated to contact you for the immediate release of your fund whose account has be come dormant and subsequently transferred to this department as unclaimed fund.Our findings have revealed that the problem behind your inability to have received your fund from the corresponding bank resulted from lack of transparency, insincerity and incessant demand for money by your representative(s) for unusual payments. We have therefore decided to establish a direct transfer payment system (DTPS) with you for the prompt release of your funds without any hitch.

We therefore request that you respond to this email immediately ( forwarding your direct contact telephpone number) to enable us proceed with the release of your fund accordingly.

Yours in service,
Dr. Brown Morgan,
