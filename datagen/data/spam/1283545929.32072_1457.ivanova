Dear Customer,

RE: INSTRUCTIONS on how TO CREDIT YOUR ACCOUNT WITH THE SUM OF
US$5,800,000.00

We at this bank wish to congratulate and inform you that after through
review of your Inheritance/Contract funds transfer release documents in
conjunction with the Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund
assessment report, your payment file was forwarded to us for immediate
transfer of a part-payment US$5,800,000.00 to your designated bank account
from their offshore account with us.

The Audit reports given to us shows that you have been going through hard
times by paying a lot of money to see to the release of your funds, which
has been delayed by some dubious officials. We therefore advice that you
stop further communication with any correspondence outside this office
since you do not have to pay any money or fee to receive your funds as you
have met up with the whole funds transfer requirements.

The only thing required from you is to obtain the Non-Residential
Clearance Form to enable us credit your account directly by telegraphic
transfer or through any of our corresponding banks and send copies of the
funds transfer release documents to you and your bankers for confirmation.

Should you follow our directives, your funds will be credited and reflect
in your bank account within five (5) bank working days from the day you
obtain this Non-Residential  Clearance Form.

For further details and assistance on this Remittance Notification, kindly
forward your FULL CONTACT ADDRESS, TELEPHONE and FAX NUMBERS directly to
my private E-mail: maureenfrankkyhead@hotmail.com

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Maureen Frank
Head, International Banking Division.
Barclays Bank PLC, UK.
