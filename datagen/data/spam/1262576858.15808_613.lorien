Dear Friend, 
Please I urgently seek your hand in a business relationship.I am the Financial controller of my Coporation in my country.I hold this position for over 11 years now and I am about to retire fron active service. 

The reality I need to explain here  to you is that I have taken out of my coporation treasury account the sum of US$25Million.I have presently lodged this fund in a suspense account where no person can know about it.By civil service status and laws,I cannot own a foreign bank account, and I cannot lodge this fund in my local account as if I do that,it will expose me.I am looking for someone who can accept to pose as owner of this fund so I can transfer this fund to him. 
This is why I have sent this email to you.Please if you will accept to partner with me to secure this fund,I will be grateful.I will give you more details of this fund transfer if I receive your reply. 

While replying,include your information as below stated: 

Your full names: 
Your full address: 
Your telephone number: 
Your age: 
Your occupation. 

Thanks for your anticipated cooperation. 
Regards,
