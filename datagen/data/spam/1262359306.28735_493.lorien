Hi, 

My name is Alexander Robert Delano , a US national, currently reside in London, 
United Kingdom, and I am a property developer/Realtor. The current worldwide 
recession has necessitated investing in the USA, and beyond for real estate 
investment/development. There will be enormous profits when the world economy 
eventually recovers in the long term. 

Therefore, I intend to invest US$22 million plus in outright purchase of prime 
properties and housing Estate development, in the USA and Canada, the Caribbean, 
Europe, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and the South Americas… 

I therefore need a Local Representative/ Agent, who will handle my interests, 
including purchase/ lease of land and Prime building properties ( Residential and 
Commercial). My Agent/representative will receive a minimum of 10% of the total 
budget spent on properties acquisition , plus all costs. To qualify, you need NOT 
be a certified Realtor, or even have experience in the real Estate business. I need 
an AGENT- ADMINISTRATOR , who can hire local professional REAL ESTATE AGENTS on my 
behalf, whose job it will be to select, appraise and value/negotiate, perform due 
diligence on properties, and finally give advice to purchase… 

If you are interested, please send to me via email your complete details, including 
your company profile. 

Thank you! 

Best regards, 

Alexander Robert Delano
