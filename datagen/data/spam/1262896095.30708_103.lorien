Dearly Beloved,

My greetings to you and your family,I am 24 years old Sese Zugulu from Zimbabwe, I am the son of the late Mr. Desmond Zugulu who was killed by president Robert Mugabe war veteran association who are calling for the white collection of farm land from all white settlers which is wrong.Presently I and my mother are living in Refugee Camp here in Ghana.

I write you this email in respect of my consignment boxes in New York,which my mother want you to assist us,by standing as our trustee ,to help us receive our consignment box containing $38.5 Million U.S.Dollars, that was deposited by my late father under a security company here in Ghana for I and my mother,presently the consignment is in New York and Mr. Martin Woods who was suppose to receive the boxes for us on our behalf is demanding  50% of the total Funds,which my mother did not agree on because that was not our initial agreement,for this reason my mother put a stop to the delivery to him,and decide to search for another trust worthy person.

We will give you 20% for the total fund involve for your assistance,because that was the agreement we have with our former beneficiary Mr. Martin Woods before he later changed is mind due to his greed,Please reply to this email with your name and phone direct number,so that we can proceed as soon as possible.

Stay blessed ,awaiting your response,my mum sends her regards.

Sese Zugulu
