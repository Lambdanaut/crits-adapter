      <small><span style="font-family: Arial;">On January 22, 2010
Mindoro
Resources Ltd. (TSXV: MIO; Frankfurt: WKN 906167) announced the
remaining results from a reconnaissance drill program at the company&#8217;s
American Tunnels gold prospect, located on the Agata Project in the
Surigao Gold District of Northern Mindanao, the Philippines. The
company reported that results have confirmed the potential for a
near-surface bulk-tonnage gold target, as well as for porphyry
copper-gold targets at deeper levels. Drill results from the first four
holes were released on October 27, 2009.</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">Mindoro has identified
widespread, near-surface intrusive-related gold mineralization at
American Tunnels, clearly demonstrating a promising bulk-tonnage gold
target. Highlights from the eight hole drill program include:<br>
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
15 m of 2.32 grams per tone (g/t) gold in hole three (from 9.3 to 24.3
m)</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.40 m
of 2.44 g/t gold in hole five (from 41.8 to 46.2 m)</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2 m
of 1.04 g/t gold in hole seven (from 20.3 to 24.5 m)</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">Continuous rock chip sampling
of underground artisanal gold workings further support the bulk-tonnage
gold potential at American Tunnels, with highlights including:</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26 m
of 1.94 g/t gold</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 m
of 2.48 g/t gold</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29.4 m
of 2.60 g/t gold</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.3 m
of 1.31 g/t gold</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">Mindoro&#8217;s President, Penny
Gould, stated, &#8220;We are pleased with the results of this initial
reconnaissance drill program. Combined with the underground sampling
results, we have confirmed the potential for both a near-surface bulk
tonnage gold target and deeper porphyry copper-gold targets. Based on
the success of this program, a much larger drill program is clearly
warranted.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">The company also noted that
drilling has now confirmed the porphyry copper-gold potential of the
much larger six kilometer target trend on the Agata project, with holes
three to seven intersecting thick sections of anomalous copper, as
follows:<br>
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hole 3: 44.4 m of 272 parts per million (ppm) copper</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hole
4: 83.5 m of 367 ppm copper (including 1.9 m of 0.28% copper)</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hole
5: 31 m of 387 ppm copper (including 2 meters of 0.15% copper)</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hole
6: 50 m of 611 ppm copper (including 1.3 meters of 0.38% copper)</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hole
7: 92 m of 310 ppm copper.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

gold results is illustrated on the map titled Gold Highlights.&nbsp;

Chalcopyrite occurs as
disseminations in country rock and as veins and veinlets associated
with alkaline porphyry-type alteration (border potassic). The
mineralization and alteration indicate close proximity to the main
potassic mineralized zone. Agata occurs in a similar geological setting
to the Anglo Boyungan and Bayugo porphyry copper-gold discoveries, also
in the Surigao District, which are now being advanced towards
production by Philex Mining.<br>
