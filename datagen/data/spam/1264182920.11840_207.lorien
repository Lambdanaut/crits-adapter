Dear Friend, 
  
I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life.
 
I saw your profile on a database during when i was searching for an organization and my spirit inspired me to contact you for the needed assignment. Though this medium internet as been greatly abused but i ask that you takes due consideration of my mail and its contents as i feel safe and prefer to deal with a foreigner or an organization on this issue.
 
I am Mrs Duan Harris a nationality of Thailand. I am married to Late Mr. STEVEN HARRIS a Canadian who worked with ESSO Thailand Co. Ltd here in Thailand before his untimely death last 4 year ago.
 
My husband died a sudden death of heart attack on the 22nd August 2006 and before his death we were truly born again christians and married for good fourteen years.
 
My only daughter which is my all died a year after the death of my husband with her two school mates on a ghastly car accident during while returning home from school vacation.
 
Since my husband and daughter's death, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$5,000,000.00 (Five Million U.S. Dollars) with a financial house. Presently, this money is still in the Bank.
 
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Six moths due to cancer problem that i have been suffering from for some years. Having known my condition I decided to look for an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. 
 
The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and i don't want my husband efforts to go into the hands of my wicked relatives the persecutors who are waiting for my death. 
 
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way this is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death anymore, hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord, Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my wicked relatives monitoring me always, I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.
 
As soon as I receive your reply with assurance that you will act accordingly as i stated herein, I shall instruct my family lawyer to prepare an Authorization letter of claiming the fund in your name then inform the financial house that you are the beneficiary of the said fund, for the release of the fund to you. 
 
You are not going to pay my attorney as i have already prepared him for this project. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian, Whosoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth.
 
Thanks and GOD bless you, i await your reply.
 
Yours sincerly
Mrs Duan Harris
