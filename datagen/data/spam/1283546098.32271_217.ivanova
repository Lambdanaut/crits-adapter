<H3><STRONG>STWA Inc. Schedules U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center Site Visit</STRONG></H3>2010-09-02 14:36 ET - News Release<BR><BR>SANTA BARBARA, CA -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 09/02/10<BR><BR>STWA, Inc. (OTCBB: ZERO) ("STWA" or the "Company"), an innovative technology company focused on improving the efficiency of large-scale energy transportation networks and reducing fuel consumption and emissions in diesel fleets, announced today that it has scheduled its initial site visit for mid-September with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) in Casper, Wyoming. <BR><BR>Management is scheduled to meet with representatives from the DOE's RMOTC and its source manufacturer to review pre-installation of the Company's AOT&#8482; technology. The DOE is evaluating AOT&#8482; to determine accurately its value to the pipeline industry. <BR><BR>"This meeting at RMOTC is the next step in our implementation strategy," stated Mr. Cecil Bond Kyte, Chairman and CEO of STWA, Inc. "Management will be accompanied by Dr. Tao, chief scientist, our source manufacturer and representatives of the DOE. We will be working to finalize testing protocols and determine variables that will be crucial to accurate testing of the prototype." <BR><BR>Mr. Kyte added, "Although our work is mostly non-transparent at this time, due to strict NDA's, we want to emphasize that we are on-track and things are moving as quickly as they can. Our decision to develop a full-scale AOT&#8482; prototype prior to ELEKTRA&#8482; is based on the number of variables that affect each technology. AOT&#8482; is being developed first as its fundamental components are directly applicable using lab data and controls, ELEKTRA's current development utilizes certain aspects of AOT's architecture as an extension of AOT&#8482; technology. This work with the DOE at RMOTC represents a tangible turning point for STWA, and as a shareholder myself, one who has never publicly sold a share, I am as confident as I have ever been," concluded Mr. Kyte. <BR><BR>About STWA, Inc. <BR><BR>STWA, Inc. (OTCBB: ZERO) is an innovative company creating technology focused on energy efficiency of large-scale energy production and improved fuel economy for diesel fleets. The Company's Patented and Patent Pending technologies, including AOT&#8482; (Applied Oil Technology), under development with Temple University, and ELEKTRA&#8482; (for Improved Diesel Engine Efficiency), provide efficient and cost-effective means of improving the efficacy of crude oil transport and diesel engine efficiency to assist in meeting global increasing energy demands and emission quality standards. Applications include: AOT&#8482; Crude oil extraction & delivery systems, including oil platforms, oil fields and pipeline transmission systems, and (ELEKTRA&#8482;) Diesel trucks, trains, marine vessels, military fleets and jet turbines. <BR><BR>More information including a company Fact Sheet, logos and media articles are available at:<BR><BR><A href="http://topequitynews01.net/go.php/737740/144394/4691494">http://www.irthcommunications.com/clients_ZERO.php</A>, and at: <A href="http://topequitynews01.net/go.php/737740/144394/4691471">http://www.stwa.com</A><BR><BR>About the RMOTC <BR><BR>The Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) is an energy testing center that partners with industry to test new ideas and products that lead to increased recovery or reduced operating costs.
