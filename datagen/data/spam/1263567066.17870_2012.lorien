Aloha, my dear friend

Daydreams take me to a place in time to a heavenly realm that is so 
sublime no barriers, no buffers, nor distance to close just two hearts 
entwining, the merging of souls. I offer you: my commitment, my time, 
my hope for the future, a shoulder to cry on, a smile to lift you up, 
an arm to gibe you strength, shelter from all harm, and a kiss to inspire 
you. I offer you my heart and all I have to give. I offer you a lifetime
of love. Take a look at me findyouramour.com/myhoney/

Warm hugs
Svetlana B.
