harles Taylor.Mr.Samuel Dokie,his wife and two Children were killed by rebe=
ls loyal to the President=A0 near Kuru village during the past crisis in Li=
beria. Since the untimely death of Mr.Samuel=A0 Dokie and his family, the m=
anagement of my company has mandated my office to make=A0 several enquiries=
 to locate any of his extended relatives, but no fruitful result was achiev=
ed=A0 as all my efforts also proved unsuccessful to locate any member of hi=
s family.

Before my=A0 observation in this development, I discovered that late Mr.Sam=
uel Dokie did not make an=A0 HEIR/WILL.=A0 The management has been delibera=
ting on how to revert this fund to the=A0 company's account since I have be=
en unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3=A0 years now. It is th=
erefore upon this discovery that I and my junior colleague in my=A0 departm=
ent decide to seek your consent to present you as the next of kin or relati=
on to the=A0 eased so that we will quickly move this money out of Senegal t=
o be delivered in your care as the next of kin or relation entitled to inhe=
rit this fund. All arrangement to move this deposited fund has been put in =
place and all I require is your honest and sincere partnership co-operation=
 to enable us see this money secured into a reliable custody.

As an insider in the company, I have all the necessary legal documents that=
 will back up the claim of this deposit and I guarantee you that this fund =
movement will=A0 be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will prote=
ct both of us from any breach of the law. On smooth completion and receipt =
of this total deposited fund, you will be entitled to your own share of the=
 total sum as gratification. We agreed that 35% of this money will=A0 be fo=
r you as our receiving partner, while 65% would be for me and my junior col=
league.=A0 Thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement and furthe=
r investment plans.You have been advised to keep this information a top sec=
ret as we are still working in the company=A0 and intend to resign from ser=
vice after this money is received in your secured bank account.
