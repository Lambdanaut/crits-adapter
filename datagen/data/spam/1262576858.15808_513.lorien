Dear Sir,=A0
=A0
I am Mr. Samuel Patrick The Chief Accountant in central bank of nigeria Plc=
,lagos. During the auditing and closing of all financial records of the Cen=
tral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) it was discovered from the records of outstandin=
g foreign account.However I got your contact Through the International web =
directory. I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more=
 Secured and private. Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge =
Amount of Money Valued at US$10.200,000.00 ( TEN MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUS=
AND US DOLLARS) that belongs to one of our late Customers who died in a pla=
ne crash.
=A0
During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came acro=
ss a very huge sum of money belonging to Mr.Ziya Bazhayev, President of the=
 Oil Alliance Company who died on Yak-40 aircraft, on a charter flight from=
 Moscow to Kiev on March 9, 2000. The fund has been dormant in his account =
with this Bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from hi=
s family or relation before our discovery of this development. The Banking =
law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for nine years,=20
=A0
it will be forfeited To the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,it is only a=
 foreigner that can stand as a next Of kin and it is upon this discovery th=
at I decided to contact you to collaborate with me to pull out this dormant=
 fund. In order to avert This negative development, I now seek your permiss=
ion to have you stand in as next of kin to our late Customer So that the fu=
nd will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary's next Of=
 kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of Kin or relative of the =
deceased,Mr.Ziya Bazhayev.
=A0
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because Of My position in thi=
s country as civil servants, I am not allowed to operate a foreign account =
and that would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of t=
ransfer since I still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why I re=
quired a second party or fellow who will assist me forward claims as the ne=
xt of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a n=
ew Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also se=
rve for this purpose.
=A0
On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as gr=
atification for your assisting me, and the remaining 60% will be for me.Wha=
t I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have in =
my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish the o=
peration. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free.Further Informa=
tion will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. I su=
ggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish.
=A0
I await your Urgent response.
=A0
Best regards,
=A0
Mr Samuel Patrick.
