Attn:Beneficiary
 
We are PARKS & ASSOCIATES, a US-based firm of debt recovery assistants 
and deal with cases where someone has entered into a deal with you and they have not
honoured their legal obligation to pay you funds to which you are legally
entitled. We have received information that you have been the victim of a
similar situation. In the United States as well as most countries of 
the world,including the whole of Europe and UK, it is against statute law for your money
to be witheld from you in respect of legally valid contracts. Not many people
know that there is such a simple legal remedy open to victims to recoup money
stolen or withheld from you in this way. It is our job to help deal with such
situations.
 
We operate on a 'no win - no fee' basis, so you as an innocent victim have
nothing to lose from using our services. If your claim is successfully
processed, we will recover our commission and costs from the accused and you
will receive reimbursement in full.

DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE SWINDLED AND DUPED - if you allow our firm to act
on your behalf in the recovery of your lost money we can help you ensure that
justice will be done.
 
Please note that the Statute of Limitations applies and we cannot 
recover money
from deals entered into more than seven years ago, otherwise we can turn your
failed deals into cash in your pocket.

If you have no interest in recovering your money or have been contacted by
mistake then just please ignore this mail. We are too busy to deal with people
who are not prepared to take the sensible action open to you.
 
If you wish to enlist our services to recover your rightfully claimed funds
please contact us at our email address. Please note for the successful
execution of this action we will require you to provide details of the 
deal andcopies of the e-mails exchanged between you and the person you want to pay up
  to you.
 
 REMEMBER - you pay us NOTHING for this service.
