you have truly been swindled by those unscrupulous persons by sending money to them through
Western Union/MoneyGram in the course of getting one fund or the other that is not real, right now we are
working hand in hand with Western Union to track every fraudsters down, do not respond to their e-mails,
letters and phone calls any longer as they are scammers and you should be very careful to avoid
being a victim to fraudsters any longer because they have nothing to offer you but to rip-off what you have
worked earnestly hard to earn.

and as a consequence of our investigations it was agreed that the sum of eighty five thousand US Dollars (US$85,000.00)
should be transferred to you out of the funds that Federal Government of Nigeria has set aside as a compensation to
everyone who have by one way or the other sent money to fraudsters in Nigeria.
