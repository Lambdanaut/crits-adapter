<p>Hello, i am Lara Portman</p>
<p>A generic drug is a drug which is produced and distributed without patent protection.
A generic must contain the same active ingredients as the original formulation. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, generic drugs are identical to the brand name counterpart with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://smilesgentle.com">Do you want to pay for the trademark? Certainly no!</a></p>



<p>If you doubt, ask <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=&as_epq=Generic+drug">Google</a> about generics.</p>
