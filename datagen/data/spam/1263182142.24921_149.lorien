Dear Friend, 

I am MAJOR.JAMES GLENN, a British soldier attached to peace keeping force
in Iraq, I Am the commanding officer of the First Battalion of the Royal
Irish Regiment, as you may know everyday, there are several cases of
insurgents attacks going on here. 

We managed to move funds belonging to some demised persons who were
attacked and killed through insurgent attacks. The total amount is US$8.4
Million dollars in cash. We want to move this money to you so that you may
keep our share for us until when we shall come over to meet you.

We will take 60%, my partner and I. You take 40%. No strings attached,
just help us move it out of Iraq, Iraq is a war zone. We plan on using
Diplomatic courier and shipping the money out using diplomatic immunity. 

If you are interested I will send you the full details, my job is to find
a good partner that we can trust and that will assist us. Can I trust you?
When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail signifying your
interest including your most confidential telephone/fax numbers for quick
communication also your contact details. 

This business is risk free as the fund can be shipped out in few days to
your doorstep, if you are interested to finalize this transaction with me
kindly get back to me with this e-mail address : mjglenn64@yahoo.com.hk

Thanks and God bless you, 

Respectfully, 
Major James Glenn.
