Dear Friend, 

How are you today? Hope all is well with you and your family?

I hope this mail meets you in a perfect condition. 

You may not understand why this mail came to you. But if you do not remember me, you might have received an email from me in the past regarding a multi-million-dollar business proposal which we never concluded. 

I am using this opportunity to inform you that this multi-million-dollar business has been concluded with another person who financed it to a logical conclusion. I thank you for your great effort to our unfinished transfer of fund into your account due to one reason or the other best known to you. 

But I want to inform you that I have successfully transferred the fund out of the security company to my new partner's account in London that was capable of assisting me in this great venture. Due to your effort, sincerity, courage and trustworthiness you showed during the course of the transaction

I want to compensate you and show my gratitude to you with the sum of $600,000.00. I have left an international certified bank draft for you worth about $600,000.00 cashable anywhere in the world. My dear friend, I will like you to contact my lawyer Mr. James Maxwell for the collection of this international certified bank draft. 

I have authorized him to release the international certified bank draft to you as soon as you contact him regarding this issue. At the moment, I'm very busy here because of the investment projects which myself and my new partner are having at hand. 

Please I will like you to accept this token with good faith as this is from the bottom of my heart. 

Also comply with Mr. James Maxwell so that he will send the draft to you without any delay. 

CONTACT: Mr.James Maxwell
ADDRESS: 15 Millmark Groove SE14 6RL,. London United Kingdom
EMAIL: james_maxwell00@hotmail.com

Therefore, you should send him your full Name and telephone number/your address where you want him to send the draft to. 

Thanks and God bless you and your family.

I am very busy now i may not reply to any email for some time. 

Best Regards,
Mr. David Moore
