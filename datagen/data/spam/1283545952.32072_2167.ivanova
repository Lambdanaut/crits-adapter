<P>Dear Beloved Friend,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I know that this letter may be a very big surprise to you, But I believe
that you will be honest to fulfil my final wish before I will die.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am Mrs. Kate Smith , I married to my beloved husband who is business
marchant t for nine years before he hard a fatal accident and died&nbsp;
and since then . I have been&nbsp; suffering from a long time cancer of the
breast&nbsp; which also affected my kedney. From all indication my
condition is really deteriorating, and my doctors have courageously advised
me that I may not live beyond the next two months, this is because the
cancer stage has reached a critical stage..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was brought up in a motherless babys home, and was married to my late
husband for twenty years without a child. My husband and I are true
Christians, but quite unfortunately, he died in a fatal motor accident.
Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited
belongings and deposited all the sum of $10.million dollars with a firm.
Presently, this money is still in their custody, and the management just
wrote me as the Legitimate beneficiary to come forward to receive the money
after keeping it for so long or rather issue a letter of authorization to
somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not come over as a result
of my illness, or they get it confiscated. Presently, I'm with my laptop in
a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I&nbsp;have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me
that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that this
money is invested in any organization of your choice and distributed each
year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless babys home
where I come from. I want your good humanitarian, to also use this money to
fund churches, orphanages and widows around. I must let you know that this
was a very hard decision, but I had to take a bold step towards this issue
because I have no further option.. I hope you will help see my last wishes
come true.</P>
