<FONT size=3>My name is Mrs.&nbsp; ISabella Carr&nbsp; a nationality of Kuwait. I am married to late Mr. JAMES Carr&nbsp; who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine&nbsp; years before he died in the year Octorber 2003. We were married for twenty years with a child. He died after a the illness that lasted for four days. Please I know this may come to you by suprise , because you did not know me, I needed your assistance that was why I write you through divine direction, it is my desire of going into relationship with you.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>Before his death we were both born again Christians.When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of&nbsp; (Ten Million&nbsp; U.S.Dollars) with one of good banks here in Cote dIvoire Presently, this money is still with the bank. Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem,Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.&nbsp; Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.I want a person or church that will use this fund to churches,orphanages, research centres and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I have a child that will inherit this money but my son can not&nbsp; carryout this work only because i and my late husband decide to use some of the money to work for God and live some for our son to have a better live.our son is just 17yearold now and been grow up in africa, he have low manterity and my husbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers,I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>
<FONT size=3>I will like you to understand that my contact to you is a divine direction from God , I dont&nbsp; want any of my husband family relatives to recieve this money but I know that&nbsp; With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact&nbsp; of the Finance/bank. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the&nbsp; church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Christian.Wh oever that wants to serve the&nbsp; Lord must serve him in spirit and truth,Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for&nbsp; a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here and Please I will like you to contact me Immediately you receive this mail so that I will instruct the Bank to !
