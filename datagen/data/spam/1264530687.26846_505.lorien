Dear Friend


I have been waiting for you since to come down here and pick your  consignment but you never respond, I have deposited the US$5,000,000.00 with the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY here in Nigeria, because I traveled to Japan to see my boss and I will not come back till next year ending.


I have arranged with the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY to get your US$5,000,000.00 to you this month and they will be coming to you with the fund inside black portfolio, I would have deposited the fund with Bank for transfer into your own account but the procedure of Bank is too much and they will required enough fee.


I drop your delivery details with the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY but I will like you to re-confirm the information to them again so that they will not be any mistake when coming with the fund. Send the below information to the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY.


(1)Full name:
(2)Address:
(3)Tel:


I want you to know that you have all right to declare how you want to receive your fund, I would have prefer the fund to be transfer to you but I make some searches about the Bank transfer and they told me that it will cost you the sum of US$4,590 to transfer the US$5,000,000.00 into your account. But I have deposited the US$5,000,000.00 in cash to the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY, below is the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY contact.


Director: Levis Marc

I have paid the delivery charges and insurance fee to the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY. The only Money that the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY will require from you is $135 Dollars for demurrage, if you can pay the $135 Dollars to them, they will proceed and get the US$5,000,000.00 to you in your Country. Pls if you want to contact the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY, you are to contact them with your portfolio code number which is (PPL111RSS) and your address where you want your portfolio delivered. You are to pay the $135 to the ALINCO SECURITY COMPANY to enable them to proceed and get the cash to you, dont fail to resend your information to them for your own good.


Regards,


Mr. Garry L. Sconford
