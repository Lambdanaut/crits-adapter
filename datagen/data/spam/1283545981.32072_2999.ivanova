Dear Friend,


I am Rev. David Johnson from Canada, I have been an international
Contractor that collects contract from Big Companies and countries, I got
Involved in one contract in Nigeria which my payment was refused, I was
Down and almost lose hope. After 2 years of this contract I later talked
To God to assist me in getting this money.
I made a vow to benefit someone with the sum of $900,000.00 draft payment
If my payment could be approved and to my surprise I was called upon by
The Nigeria Government sometimes last month that my contract files have
Been looked into and it is ready for payment. I never believed it until I
Was advised by my Pastor and later moved down to Nigeria and to my
Unbelievable surprise I was paid this money.
Due to my pledge to God I have agreed to show the person that I will be
Sending the $900,000.00 through ballot system on the internet which
Happened to be your email so you are lucky.
What you have to do now is to get in touch with my secretary Mr. Robert Dennis
And instruct him on how to send your $900,000.00 Bank draft to
You. BELOW IS THE CONTACT OF MY SECRETARY


Mr. Robert Dennis
E-mail address: robertdennis099@gmail.com
Contact Number: +234-802-402-1152


Send to my secretary your contact address and telephone number, let him
Make arrangement for the shipment of your draft to your doorstep and also
You can give him a call to confirm your address. What I want you to believe
Now is that this is the opportunity which God have promised you this year
So it is better you have it in time before it goes again from you so
Contact my secretary in time. And for your information presently I am in
The United Kingdom for another contract so i want you to go into prayer
With me for the success of this contract. With Best



Regards,
Rev. David Johnson
