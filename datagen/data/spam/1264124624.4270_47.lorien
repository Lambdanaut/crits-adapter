Hello Friend

In search of a Trustee

My name is Mrs Rosemary King I am a dying woman who has decided to donate
what I have to  charities  through you. You may be wondering why I chose
you. But
someone has to be chosen. I am old and was diagnosed for cancer, after the
death of my husband who had left me everything he worked for.

I have been touched by the Lord to donate from what I have inherited from my
late husband to charity through you for the good work of humanity. I have
asked the Lord to forgive me all my sins and I believe he has, because He is
merciful.


I will be going in for an operation, and I pray that I survive the
operation.

I have decided to Will/Donate the sum of Five Million Five hundred thousand
Dollars to charities through you for the good work of the Lord, and to
help the motherless,less privileged and also for the assistance of the
widows.

Presently, I have informed my consultant about my decision in willing this
fund to charity through you. I wish you all the best and may the good Lord
bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the
good work to others.

If you are interested in carrying out this task, I will inform my
consultant. I know i have never met you but my mind tells me to do this,and I
hope you act sincerely.



I sincerely know that a lot has been written about some SCAM coming out of
the world, but I assure you that this will never in any way associated with
that as you will be given the right to verify this directly with the Bank
were the funds is presently deposited.


Kindly reply me through my private email: rose.king883@yahoo.com.hk


Your sincerely,
Mrs Rosemary King
