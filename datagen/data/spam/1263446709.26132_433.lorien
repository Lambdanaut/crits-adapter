<DIV>
<FONT size=2 color=#000000 face="Gautami">My name is Robert Le Blanc, the operation manager of Credit Suisse Bank in London and I would like to solicit for your confidence on a business deal which will be of immense benefit to both of us. Before I go on it may interest you to know that I got your contact detail from the BRITISH NETWORK EXCHANGE online, inrespect to your position and good personality, apparently I was also assured of your ability to prosecute a transaction of this magnitude involving a huge sum of money from a deceased foreign customer deposited here in the bank where I work.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
<FONT size=2 color=#000000 face="Gautami">Previously I discovered the sum of £47,798,060.00 GBP belonging to (late) Dr. Michael Woods who died along with his wife and two kids on a plane crash. But since his death, none of his relation has come forward to claim his money in our bank as the next of kin and I wish to seek for your permission to have you stand as the family representative to the deceased because our bank will not release the money unless someone applies for claim.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=2 color=#000000 face="Gautami">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=2 color=#000000 face="Gautami">Please, I need your co-operation to retrieve the money into your bank account because the British banking policy and guideline stipulates that any funds belonging to a deceased person for a period of 5years will be transferred into the Bank treasury as an unclaimed debt. However, I know that a message like this can make you apprehensive and curious considering the fact that you do not know me in person; especially at this time when people are self-conscious due to the news that overflow with scam, money laundering and grotesque events around the world. My due assurance to you is that this business proposal is of good faith and 100% risk free, and I am privy to all Information that will be used to facilitate the release of the money to you. So, if you are willing to accept my proposal, kindly reply my mail by indicating your interest. Thereafter percentages with more information will be relayed to you on my next mail.</FONT></DIV>
