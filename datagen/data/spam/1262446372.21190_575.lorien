Dear Friend, 

  I work as an international auditor for a reputable Bank (ALM) Asset Liability
Managerial department monitoring five branches including Singapore, Belgium
and Netherlands. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal 
endeavors which I may explain to you upon your response. 
A possible family member of yours (name withheld for security reason) died
nine months ago leaving behind an investment totaling a very tidy sum with my bank. 
With interest at today's value, the said investment has grown considerably.
His lawyer has since notified my department of the sudden death of the said
investor in a car crash and the
lawyer has also asked us to check through our records to see who his client
may have indicated as next
of kin to the investment, since the fiance (Derby Myrthe) who was indicated
in his WILL as beneficiary to
most of his properties also died in the same car crash.

Findings and verification as auditor in the bank has led me to realize that
the investor has also named his
fiance as next of kin to the investment. We have as yet not informed anyone
of this because of the
implications, the investor's lawyer will obviously handover his properties
including the investment to the
government which will in turn be shared amongst undeserving government
officials. However, because of
the relevance of the sameness of your surname and you being a possible
relative to the late investor, we
are making you this proposal since my boss and I can provide you with much
needed information to claim
the investment. 

You are guaranteed that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any
breach of the law, as the funds did not originate from terrorism or drugs,
but through inheritance.
Please kindly reply through my private email (jacobstorck7@aol.com) to
confirm your full name, telephone
and fax number to enable us discuss and facilitate all due process regarding
this transaction. 

Yours truly, 
Jacob.
