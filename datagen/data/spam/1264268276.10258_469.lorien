Dear Sir/Madam,



First of all, It is pertinent that I implore you to keep the details which I'm about to furnish you with as discretly as possible. This project is very sensitive. However, If you follow my instructions very religiously, we are 100% sure to succeed.


I'm a British citizen working with a security/finance company(Royal London Unit Trust Managers) in the United Kingdom, where I am currently the assistant
principal officer attached to Investment/records department. 



By virtue of my position, I am priviledged to classified information about funds deposited with our institutiion, amounting to $18.5m USD (EIGHTEEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) domicile in an account owned by a Dutch nationalist, Mr Collins Mzizi who has been confirmed dead from
a very reliable source back home, unknown to the management of my firm.


The interesting thing here is that there is no beneficiary or next of kin attached to the funds and this implies that no one will ever come forward to claim the funds. 

My intention therefore is to seek for a serious minded beneficiary, to process this sum by standing as next of kin to his account before it gets to the knowledge of my top management staff who will ultimately confiscate the funds for there personal use.



I will make sure I provide all necessary documents to back up your claims as beneficiary/next of kin to the late Collins Mzizi, so you do not have to worry at
all.


Furthermore, I wish to inform you that at the conclusion of this project, we are to share its proceeds equally.


If you are genuinly interested, send me your name and contact details immediately, so I can give you further details regarding this
project. Upon receipt of your mail, stating your willingness to be of assistance, I will also send you my contact details so we can have a clear conversation.


NOTE: You MUST keep details of this project confidential, as my position is very sensitive.



Best Wishes,
Joseph Young.
