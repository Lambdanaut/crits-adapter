Hong Kong,


THIS IS FOR YOUR ATTENTION

I sincerely ask for forgiveness for I know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my best option of communication. This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as frivolous could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility

This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before neither in person nor by correspondence,but I believe that it takes just one day to meet or know someone either physically or through correspondence.

I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship,and one has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial business transaction. I am Liu Yan a transfer supervisor operations in investment section in Bank of China Ltd. Secretariat of the BOCHK Charitable Foundation 13/F. Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road,Hong Kong I have an obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of (19.5million United States Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war,again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him,We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim Ali and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that General Mohammed Jassim Ali did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, (19.5million United States Dollars) is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that, according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
 
 I would have gone ahead to ask  the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line  in my involvement in claiming the deposit.Further more be informed that the fact that you are a foreigner give  you the privilege to stand in as my deceased client beneficiary as my  deceased client had no relation all his family died with him during  the war and I can not use my relation because its not accepted here in Hong Kong.


Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali so that you will be able to receive his funds.I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. 

I have contacted an attorney who will prepare the legal documents that will back you up as the next of kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number and Address so that the attorney can commence his job,which you have emailed me. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be provided by you with my guidance.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. 
Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.
 
With these: all is done.I am  aware of the consequences of this proposal.
 I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should  discard this mail.I ask that you do not be vindictive and  destructive.If my offer is of no appeal to you,delete this message  and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.You may not know this but people like  myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the  whole private banking sector.I am not a criminal and what I do, I do  not find against good conscience,this may be hard for you to understand,but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this  move.
Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime.I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances won't pass me by.I ask that you  do not destroy my chance,if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities.
 If you give me positive signals,I will initiate this process towards  a conclusion.I wish to inform you that should you contact me via  official channels;I will deny knowing,I do not want you contacting me through my official phone  lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email  account.Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you  and also through the email account that i will provide therein in this  email: gramwhyte@aim.com


My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our  level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy,that is why i would not like you to contact me via my official line. Please observe this instruction religiously.Please, again,note I am a family man, I have wife and children.I send you this mail  not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and  riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.This is the one truth  I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence.If we can be of one accord,we should plan a meeting,soon.Should you be interested
Best Regards

Liu Yan
