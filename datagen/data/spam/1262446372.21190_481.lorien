 Attention: Beneficiary
 
  INSTRUCTION TO CREDIT YOUR BANK ACCOUNT
 
 
 This is to notify you about the position of your fund . After due vetting and evaluation of 
 your Inheritance /contract payment file, which was Forwarded by Federal Republic of Nigeria 
 via Central Bnak of Nigeria,we have been instructed to contact you for the immediate release 
 of your payment. 
 
 
 From our findings, you have been going through hard ways by paying a lot of charges to see to 
 the release of your fund US$25,000,000.00 which has been delayed. We advise that you stop 
 further communication with any correspondence from Nigeria as your fund is no longer in 
 Nigeria.
 
 You don't have to pay any charges to receive your Inheritance /contract payment fund anymore
 as you have met up with the whole requirements; your representatives in Africa, will tell 
 you to still go ahead with them but on your own risk as we are presenly in charge of your payment.
 
 However, the only thing required from you is to provide us your Payment Clearance Certificate(PCC),
 your full name,residential direct telephone and fax number.
 
 At this point, you need to understands that the Government of Nigeria has paid us for 
 handling/processing of your payment with other beneficiaries.
 
 If the Payment Clearance Certificate(PCC) has not been issued to you in the past,we will help 
 you to secure it so that our bank will effect immediate transfer of your inheritance sum 
 of US$25,000,000.00 in to your nominated bank account. If you comply directives, your 
 fund will reflect in your account within five Banking days from the day you obtain your 
 Payment Clearance Certificate(PCC) . 
 
 Do not go through anybody again but through this Bank if you really want your fund.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 DR DAVID SCOTT
 DIRECTOR OF REMITTANCE.
