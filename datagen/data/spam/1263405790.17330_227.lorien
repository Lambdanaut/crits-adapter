When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and=

Allah about you.In=A0 my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 7 m=
illion U.S.A dollars ( SEVEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS=A0 U.S.A dollars=
 Only) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer MR SALLA=
=A0 KHATIF who died along with his entire family on (friday december 25TH,2=

=A0
We have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money bec=
ause we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or =
relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfort=
unately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongs=
ide with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is =
therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now =
decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you=
 as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent d=
isbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go=
 into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline he=
re stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the mo=
ney will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.=20
=A0
The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by t=
hefact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as n=
ext of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 40% of this money will be for you =
as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % =
will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 50 % would b=
e for me, Therefore after I and my family will visit you in your country fo=
r disbursement according to the percentages indicated.
=A0
Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged=
, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the decea=
sed indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telep=
hone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where=
 the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you =
by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to you=
