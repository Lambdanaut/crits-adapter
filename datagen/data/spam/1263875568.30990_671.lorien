Hello,

I apologize if the contents hereunder are contrary to your moral ethics, but please treat it with absolute secrecy and personal courtesy. I am Johnson S.Andy Jr. an Auditor in a Bank here in London UK, in the process of auditing our bank accounts for the first quarter of the year, I recently discovered that there was a dormant account valued at the sum GBP 7,496,290.00 (Seven Million, four hundred and ninety six thousand, two hundred and ninety British Pounds Sterling) and after due verification of this account I discovered that the account owner is late. That is why the account has been dormant and as such the funds are lying unclaimed in the bank.

The idea of presenting a foreigner to act as his next of kin came into my mind so as to have the total sum of GBP 7,496,290.00 Pounds being transferred and willed to you and we can both disburse the fund according to the percentage we will agree upon.

In view of this, I am seeking for your co-operation and understanding to stand as the next of kin to our deceased customer, to enable us claim the fund from my bank. Hence, if this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take undue advantage of my trust. Please kindly get back to me immediately, strictly via my private email address only: ( johnkoria@googlemail.com ) to enable me enlighten you on how we are to proceed.

I will appreciate if the details below are confirmed back to me in your next email in order for me to prepare the MOU, MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING that both of us will endorse in other for both parties to be protected.

FULL NAME:
PHONE NUMBER:
SEX:
AGE:
NATIONALITY:
OCCUPATION/PROFESSION:

On getting your response with the above details, we shall agree on the percentage ratio on how the funds shall be splitted between ourselves, as I intend to invest part of our own share in real estate or any lucrative business in your country, and I would appreciate if you can put me in the right part where I can invest my own share.

Be rest assured that this business is 100% risk free.

I await for your prompt response.

Best Regards,
Johnson S.Andy Jr.
Chief Auditor,
Natwest Bank Group.
London - United Kingdom.

NB: PLEASE NOTE THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE NOT RELATED TO MY LATE CLIENT OR NOT; THE FUND WILL STILL BE PAID TO YOU, SINCE I AM PRESENTING YOU AS HIS NEXT OF KIN.
