Attention: 
 
I am Mr Dalton William. I work with HSBC London, a   Global financial institution. My colleagues and I are conducting a standard process investigation involving my client who shares the same Last name with you, and also the circumstances surrounding the domiciled estate made with our bank. Our client as the subject matter died intestate with his only daughter and nominated no next of kin to inherit this Funds valued at USD$ 18 Million Dollars. The essence of this communication with you is that you kindly assist me on three questions:
 
1-Are you aware of any relative/relation having the same surname, whose great grand parents emigrated from your country a long time ago?

2-Are you aware of any investment with HSBC Bank of   London of substantial value made by such an individual with the same last name as yours?

3-Being the account/portfolio manager to the deceased would you be able to receive this funds contrary to the above questions if we legally present you to our bank, with our official capability, providing all legal backup documentations beyond all reasonable doubt, to assume status of a heir to the deceased as a relative, based on your same last name?

It is important that you inform me of your interest on this matter that we may come to an understanding as a team to put an end to this enquiry. 

Mr Dalton William.
