I am Prof.Stive Malusa, the Auditor of the Ministry of Urban and Rural=
 Development but on trade mission in Europe now. It is true we have no=
t met before but I got your contact address via your country chamber o=
f commerce. I decided to contact you with a business proposal that wil=
l be of mutual benefit to all of us, though the source does not know t=
he nature or exact business we want to transact with you.
=20
In 1998, my Ministry awarded a contract for the construction of Centra=
l Sewage Tanks at three of Zimbabwean Cities. The real value of this c=
ontract was=20
US$35.5 Million.  However, some very top officials at the Ministry and=
 me used our position to inflate this contract value to US$55.250 Mill=
ion without the knowledge of the government in power then. This contra=
ct was approved and the original contractor has successfully executed =
the contract and has received their due contract sum of  US$35.5Millio=
n.This payment was made to them under contract number FMRD/PED/4126A/0=
X04/98, leaving out the over inflated surplus of US$20.250 Million whi=
ch is now ready cash boxed to be transferred for this purpose.=20
However, it is not allowed for government officials in my country to o=
pen and operate offshore account. This is why we need your urgent assi=
stance to provide us with a good cover where the fund will be remitted=
 into, before we disburse it in a ratio that will be acceptable to bot=
h parties.=20

To  my confidential email address stivemalusa@inbox.com=20
to enable me provide you with additional information. I assure you of =
100% risk free in this transaction as we have done our homework very w=
ell to ensure a hitch free remittance of this fund into your account, =
and we are willing to give you a huge percentage of the fund as your s=
hare for assisting us, when the money clears in your account. I thank =
you very much for your anticipated co-operation while we look forward =
to your prompt response to this letter. We sincerely hope you would un=
derstand the confidentiality of this mail as we are still serving staf=
f of the Ministry and would not want any thing that will jeopardize ou=
r long years in service.
