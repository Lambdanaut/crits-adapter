MY LITTLE TOKEN WITH GOOD FAITH

My Dear Friend.

Due to your effort, sincerity, courage and trust worthiness you showed at the course of the Uk Online Lotto winning cheque shipment to your location, I want to compensate you and show my gratitude to you with the sum of $500,000USD (Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) I have authorized the finance house where I deposited the money to issue you international certified bank draft cashable at your bank.

My dear winner,I will like you to contact the CEO in charge of the finance house for the collection of this international certified bank draft.

The name of the Person with your Cheque is Barr. Steve Richard

EMAIL: barr.steve.richard@gmail.com

At the moment, I am very busy in Sydney because of the investment projects which myself and my new partner Mr. Peter Hills of CTL Express Delivery Company are having at hand. Finally, remember that I have forwarded instruction to Mr. Steve Richard at the finance house on your behalf to send the bank draft to you as soon as you contact him without delay. Please I will like you to accept this token with good faith as this is from the bottom of my heart. Thanks and God bless you and your family. Hope to hear from you soon.

My sincere advice to you as a christian is that you should endeavour to pay your tithe to a bible believing church when you get the money because I noticed it as a fudiciary agent that you were skeptical about your winnings when you were been ask by the Uk lotto Agency Inc to file out a claim for your prize. And now the current policy of the Lotto organiser is that if an emerged winner fails to claim up his/her winning cheque of $500,000 it's now mandatory that this fund can be remitted or forfeited to the fudiciary agent in charge of this winners file.

However, I want you to contact him immediately as soon as you receive this information because he is leaving for the US by the end of this month and this might cost a delayment for you to receive this draft.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr Derick Richard
