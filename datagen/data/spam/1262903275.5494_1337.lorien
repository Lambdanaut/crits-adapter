My name is Mr. Jan and I am contacting you from Liberia for a
mutualbusiness relationship and investment.  I have some funds realized
through
contract brokerage and I need your cooperation to invest the funds.  The
first stage requires transferring the funds to your account for subsequent
investment.  I therefore want you to work with me as a partner.  On
receipt of your response, I will send you full details of the transaction
and more information about myself.  I am waiting for your prompt response.
Please send your reply to mrr_jan@rocketmail.com

Jan
