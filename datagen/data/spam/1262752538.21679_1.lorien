Acknowledge,

An Iraqi made a fixed deposit of $6.5m usd in 
my bank branch (Hang Seng Bank,Hong Kong) where 
am a director and he died with his entire family 
in the war leaving behind no next of kin, I'm ready 
to share 50/50 with you if you choose to stand as my 
deceased client next of kin. If interested mail me at 
the address below.
