Perience. He lives from hand to mouth. He luxuriates in time of
plenty,
and he starves in times of scarcity. He lives in a rude nest or in a
hole in the ground,
and in small communities;

he builds a few deep cells or sacks in which he stores
a little honey and bee-bread for his young, but as a worker in wax he
is of the most primitive and awkward. The Indian regarded the
honey-bee as an ill-omen. She was the white man's fly. In fact she was
the epitome of the white
man himself. She has the white man's craftiness, his industry, his
architectural skill, his neatness and love of system, his foresight;
and above all his eager, miserly habits. The honeybee's great ambition
is to be rich,
to lay up great stores, to possess the
sweet of every flower that blooms. She is more than provident. Enough
will not satisfy her, she must have all she can get by hook or by
crook. She comes from the
oldest country, Asia, and thrives best in the most fertile and
long-settled
lands. Yet the

fact remains that the honey-bee is essentially a wild creature, and
never has been and cannot be thoroughly domesticated. Its proper home
is the woods, and thither every new swarm counts on going; and thither
many do go in spite of the care and watchfulness

of the bee-keeper. If the woods in any given

locality are deficient in trees with suitable cavities, the bees
resort to all sorts of makeshifts; they go into chimneys, into barns
and outhouses, under stones, into rocks, and so forth. Several
chimneys in my locality with disused flues are taken possession of by
colonies of bees nearly
