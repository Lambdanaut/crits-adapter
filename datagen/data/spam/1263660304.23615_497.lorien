Dear Friend,

I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life.

I believe you are a respected personality considering the fact that i sourced your profile from a human resource profile database of your country.

However strange or surprising this contact might seems to you as we have not met before either physically or through correspondence, but i ask that you take good consideration of my mail as i prefer it's safe dealing with someone outside my country.

Though this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused,but i choose reaching you via email as i prefered it's save and secured as i don't want peoples around me to know anything about the deal. However, this correspondence is purely private, and it should be treated as such.

I am the above named person from Thailand. I am married to late MR.STEVEN HARRIS a Canadian who worked with ESSO Thailand Co. Ltd here in Thailand before his death last 4 years ago as a result of his heart problem.
 
My husband died a sudden death of heart attack on the 22nd of August 2006 and Before he died we were born again christians and we were married for fourteen years.

My only daughter died in a car accident with her two school mates early november 2007 on their way back home from vacation.

Since the death of my husband and my daughter, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$ 5,000,000.00 (Five Million U.S. Dollars) with a financial house. Presently, this money is still in the Bank.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next six months due to a serious cancer problem that i have been battling with for the past five years. Having known my condition I decided to look for an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers.
 
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way.This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord, Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the financial house that you are the beneficiary of the said fund so that they can release the fund to you.
 
I will introduce you to my family lawyer that will prepare an authorization letter of claiming the fund without any attorney fee. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

Thanks and God bless you, you are advised to fill in all the below information once you assured me that you will act accordingly as i stated. You are not going to pay my family lawyer because i have already taken care of him concerning this project.
