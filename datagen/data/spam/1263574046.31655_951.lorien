Gooday Sir/Madam,

I have been waiting for you since to contact me for your Confirmable Bank Draft of $8.500.000.00 Million United States Dollars, but I did not hear from you since for a couple of weeks now. Then I went to the bank to confirm if the draft has expired or getting near to expire and Dr. Eze the Director Bank of Africa told me that before the draft will get to your hand that it will expire. So I told him to cash the (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars Only )$8.500.000.00 Million UNITED STATES DOLLARS to cash payment to avoid losing the fund.

What you have to do now is to contact dhl Courier Comapny as soon as possible to know when they will deliver your Consignment to you before the expiring date. For your information, I have paid for the delivering Charge.

The only money you will send to the DHL Courier Comapny to deliver your Consignment direct to your postal Address in your country and the only fees you have to pay them is ($165usd) for the creating of the Certificate of Origin in your favour before the DHL Company can deliver your consignmet box to you., I would have paid that but they said no because they don't know when you will contact them and in case of demurrage.

Note: You have to contact DHL Courier now for the delivery of your Consignment box with this information below:

DR.WILLIAMS MEGASS
DIRECTOR,DHL FOREIGN DELIVERY SECTION
Email:drmegass@mail2Guard.com 
Tel: +229 98817873
DHL EXPRESS COURIER COMPANY Benin Republic.

Finally, make sure that you reconfirm your Postal address and Direct telephone number to them again to avoid any mistake on the Delivery and ask them to give you the tracking number to enable you track your package over there and know when it will get to your address.\Let me repeat again try to contact them as soon as you receive this mail to avoid any further delay and remember to pay to send them the charges for the creaing of Certificate of Origin in your name|favour.

Note :The DHL Courier don't know the contents of the Box. I registered it as a BOX of Africa cloths. The DHL Courier did not know that the Box contain money. I did this for security reason and to aviod delaying with the BOX . I am waiting for your urgent response.

Yours Faithfully,
Adriana Fanton
