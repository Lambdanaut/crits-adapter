   ABOUT MY WILL

Greetings ,Pls let this not sound strange to you for my only surviving son 

who would have done this died early this year.i prayed and got your email 

id from your country's guestbook.I am Mrs.Ruby Eustaquio,i am presently 

in London where i am hospitalized for now because i work here ,I am 

suffering from a long time cancer of the breast which also affected my 

brain,from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it is 

quite obvious that, according to my doctors they have advised me that i 

may not live for the next two months,this is because the cancer stage has 

gotten to a very bad stage.I was brought up from an orphanage home and 

was married to my late husband for twenty years with an only son who 

died along his father in a fatal motor accident in Nigeria ,my husband was 

working in a mobile company in Saudi Arabia before he won a contract 

with the shell company of Nigeria..
 
Since his death I decided not to re-marry,I sold all my inherited 

belongings and deposited all the sum of 13.8 million dollars with a Eco 

Bank Plc NIGERIA).Presently,I am in London and this money is still with 

the bank and the management just wrote me as the account benefactor to 

come forward to receive the money or rather issue a letter of 

authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf.         

 

Since I can not come over because of my illness,i should not allow such 

amount of money to be consficated, Presently I'm with my laptop in a 

special care unit in london ,where I have been  undergoing treatment for 

the cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told 

me that I have only a few months to live.It is my last wish to see that this 

money is invested to any organisation of your choice and distributed 

each year among the charity organizations,orphanages and breast cancer 

treatment programmes. I want  to trust you as God fearing person,  use 

this money to empower the less privileges and widows,I took this 

decision, before i will rest in peace because my time will soon be up.As 

soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of my account 

officer Eco  Bank Plc(NIGERIA).I will also issue you a letter of authority 

that will prove you as the new beneficiary of my fund. Please assure me 

that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.
Hoping to hear from you soon.

Mrs.Ruby Eustaquio
