Dear Friend,

Today is the one-year anniversary of President Obama's inauguration, and =
it comes at a remarkable moment in his presidency.

Yesterday, the voters in my home state of Massachusetts elected a =
Republican to serve in the seat once held by Senator Ted Kennedy -- a =
stunning reminder that for millions of people, the last election wasn't =
just about one man, but about a deep-seated desire for change.

One year ago today was a moment when many things felt possible, whether or =
not you supported Obama and his agenda -- when it seemed as if a broken =
political system might finally have gasped its last breath.

One year later -- with the fate of its signature legislative priority in =
jeopardy and voters even in a deep blue state saying they still aren't =
satisfied with the ways of Washington -- it's clear that this =
administration is an opportunity missed. But it's not, I believe, because =
Obama is too liberal, nor because he's not liberal enough. Not because =
this administration has been too defensive, too aggressive, too slow or =
too quick to act. It's because we have a system in Washington that simply =
does not -- will not -- allow the kind of change we urgently need.

After one year, we've now seen conclusively that even a transformative =
figure in the Oval Office can't transform the way Washington works, or =
dispel the skepticism the voters feel toward their government.=20

I've filmed a new installment of the Change Congress Chronicles explaining =
why progressives and conservatives alike should be outraged by what we've =
seen this past year. Please watch it today:

http://action.change-congress.org/YearOne

As you know, today is also the day we might get a landmark decision from =
the Supreme Court that could poison the system even further, giving =
corporations unlimited license to use their money to affect elections in =
this country. It's a big day.

I'll let you know as soon as we've heard.

Thanks,

Lawrence Lessig
