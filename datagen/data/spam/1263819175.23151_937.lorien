Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts to locate any member of his family/relatives hence I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposit were lodged. Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about US$15.5 Million Dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next Twenty one official working days. 
 
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 5 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$15.5 million dollars can be paid to you, as the Next of Kin to my deceased client, and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us conclude this deal.
 
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. please get back to me with the under listed information to enable us proceed immediately.
