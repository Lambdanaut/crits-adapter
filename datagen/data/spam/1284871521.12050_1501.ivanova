Dear friend,
I saw your brief contact on web directory during a comprehensive online search. Please accept my sincere apology,if i am interfering on your privacy.

With due respect, I am Dr.J.B.Elliot working in a pharmaceutical company based in London, United Kingdom.

I contacted you regarding our company urgent need for a supplier of a medicinal herbal seeds exported from India. These herbal seeds are locally preserved for medicinal purposes. Our company manufacture most of it's major produce with these herbal seeds.

These seeds are sourced and sold in India at the rate of $70 USD per 5 grams packet but our company buy at the rate of $160 USD per 5 grams packet from the former supplier (Deceased).

After the sudden death of the former supplier, the management of our company are very much in-need of another supplier of these herbal seeds. Meanwhile nobody in the company knows the source of these materials except the former supplier and me. I kept this information to myself due to my personal interest in this business opportunity.

I intend to establish a mutual business relationship with a company or an individual in India whom i can introduce to our director as a local seller. This person will take orders and supply these herbal seeds directly to our company at a high rate then we will share the profit.

You and i can explore this business opportunity since our company management is not aware of the source and selling price in India. If you can invest in buying the herbal seed from the local seller and supply to our company, I will give you the contact detail of a local seller and also introduce you to my director as a supplier then our company can buy directly from you.

This will be a long term business relationship that will not affect your present occupation.

If you are interested please reply through my private email address Dear friend,
