I am Mrs. Flora Wilfred, the wife of Mr. Wilfred Hamilton; both of us are
citizens of the  United States. I know you will be surprised to read this
email and why I have to address  myself to you at first, but I have no
choice rather to share my feelings and ideas with you  because I felt you
will be willing and capable to help me conclude this project in good
faith. My husband have been working with the Oil and Gas Industry (Shell
Chevron Texaco  Company) in Russia before he died in the year 2003, and my
husband made a deposit of (8.9  Million Pounds) with a Bank in Europe. And
the management just wrote to me as the  beneficiary that our account has
been dormant and if I cannot activate the account the  funds will be
confiscated by the firm. Ever since the loss of my husband I have not been
able to comfort myself. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Russia where I
have been undergoing  treatment for esophageal cancer. Please, I need you
to help me stand as beneficiary of the  Funds and help me disburse the
money to the charity homes of which 20% will be given to you.

Please do contact me immediately for assistance towards this project and I
assure you that  it's 100% free risk.

Mrs. Flora Wilfred.
