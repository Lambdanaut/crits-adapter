Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Abii Debe; A Staff  of International Trust Bank Plc Accra Ghana, I am the Credit management and recovery manager with the Company office in Ghana before I was transferred to our head office here in Abuja Nigeria, Late Engineer Wilson was my personal Client before he died in an accident, he was a contractor with Shell Development Company and he is from your Country.

On the 21st of April 2007, Engr. Wilson, his wife and their two children were involved in a car accident along Platue express road and all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Before  the time of his death, he had a deposit of $14.5 Million which he declared as family treasure in the Finance House Accra office where I was working then, which is only I and his lawyer knows the true content, Unfortunately, till this moment no person has come as his relation for  his chattels with us. I humbly request your attention to this matter so that I can present you as his next of kin and beneficiary to his chattels. It is not a very difficult thing to do and it will not take time.

All I will need is to put your name and particulars as his next of kin to in our computer database and we file in an application for the release of the fund in Ghana to conclude the deal, we may request that the money be sent to Europe for your collection.

Please contact me as quickly as possible through this email address (adebe35@yahoo.it) treat this matter as very important and confidential.

When I hear from you, we shall discuss the terms of sharing of the money after the claim. Contact me now so that I can delegate the Attorney who is also going to be part of the deal.

I await your urgent response.

Best regards,

Mr. Abii Debe
