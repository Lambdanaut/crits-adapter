Dear beloved friend,

with warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings, I hope this mail meet
you in good time. However, as we have not met personally or had any
dealings in the past. I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance
and immense benefit.I sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
I am Mrs. Lina Diaz widow to the Late Mr. Ken Diaz; I am 65 yrs old,
I am a new Christian convert working as a missionary in West Africa before I
Was urgently transfer to my home country here in United Kingdom, am suffering
From long time cancer of the breast, from all indication my condition is really
Deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't live more than two
Months, According to my doctors. This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage.
My late husband was killed during the U.S raid against terrorism in Afghanistan, and during the period of our marriage we had a 23 yrs old son who
Died in an auto crash three years ago.
My late husband was very wealthy and after his death I inherited all his business and wealth. The doctor has advice me that I may not live for more than two months,
so I now decided to divide the part of this wealth, to contribute to the development of the church in Africa, America, Asia and also in Europe.
I prayed over it, and I am willing to donate the sum of One Million Great Britain pounds (1,000,000.00 GP) to the less privileged and orphanage Home. God
Has directed me to you and I wont you to use this funds to work for God, Please
I want you to note that this fund is lying in a Bank in West Africa
And upon my instruction, my Bank will proceed with there transfer
Procedures once they get some vitals information from you as my next
Beneficiary.

Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be used for the
said purpose, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without
Christ is vanity. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus the love of God and the
Fellowship of God be  with you and your family. I await your urgent reply
Please kindly get back to me if you are willing to help for further details

Yours in Christ,

Mrs. Lina Diaz
