<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Truth about Oil<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#226;&#128;&#153;s true, world oil reserves stand about a third higher today <br />
</p>
<p>than where they stood in 1974. But there is one huge <br />
</p>
<p>difference. In 1974 world reserves were climbing like a rocket. <br />
</p>
<p>Today they are falling fast. The vast rich reservoirs have <br />
</p>
<p>seemingly all been found. True, this recession has created a <br />
</p>
<p>temporary lull in demand. But nothing that justifies the <br />
</p>
<p>halving of oil prices<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Life after the Crash, &#226;&#128;&#156;If 2005 was the year of <br />
</p>
<p>global Peak Oil, worldwide oil production in the year 2030 will <br />
</p>
<p>be the same as it was in 1980. However, the world&#226;&#128;&#153;s population <br />
</p>
<p>in 2030 will be both much larger (approximately twice) and much <br />
</p>
<p>more industrialized (oil-dependent) than it was in 1980.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, worldwide demand for oil will outpace worldwide <br />
</p>
<p>production of oil by a significant margin.&#226;&#128;&#157; TheStar.com weighs <br />
</p>
<p>in with this: &#226;&#128;&#156;Lower oil prices are almost certainly a <br />
</p>
<p>short-term development &#226;&#128;&#147; and one that threatens to lull us into <br />
</p>
<p>a false sense of security about future oil supplies.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#226;&#128;&#156;The reality remains that oil is a finite resource, a precious <br />
</p>
<p>one-time inheritance we've used up recklessly over the past <br />
</p>
<p>century. As a result, we've already consumed most of the <br />
</p>
<p>Earth's easily accessible oil. Much of what's left can be <br />
</p>
<p>produced only with great difficulty, at enormous environmental <br />
</p>
<p>and financial cost.&#226;&#128;&#157;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will leave you with one final thought: the International <br />
</p>
<p>Energy Agency recently reported that the world's major oil <br />
</p>
<p>fields are declining much faster than previously thought.  Last <br />
</p>
<p>year the agency actually conducted a comprehensive study of the <br />
</p>
<p>world's 800 largest oil fields and concluded that the natural <br />
</p>
<p>annual rate of output decline is an alarmingly high 9.1 <br />
</p>
<p>percent, double previous estimates.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is different from the Canadian oil sands where technology <br />
</p>
<p>seem to be driving and expansion of the reserve.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#226;&#128;&#153;s why Tamm Oil and Gas (OTCBB:TAMO), with its very low <br />
</p>
<p>price, represents such a unique energy-sector opportunity <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Energy Investor:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is nothing short of the most price-sensitive document you <br />
</p>
<p>will read this year...<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is ultra-sensitive because it details the stunning exploits <br />
</p>
<p>of a company called Tamm Oil and Gas (OTCBB:TAMO).<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, a geeky engineer and a skeptical, ultra conservative <br />
</p>
<p>Swiss analyst have determined that Tamm Oil and Gas is poised <br />
</p>
<p>to produce minimum 65,000 to 85,000 barrels of heavy oil per <br />
</p>
<p>day... and get this... that&#226;&#128;&#153;s every day for as along the next <br />
</p>
<p>25 years!<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works out to be more than 775 million barrels over the <br />
</p>
<p>project&#226;&#128;&#153;s life... stunning numbers that, over the long haul, <br />
</p>
<p>could drive Tamm Oil and Gas shares to nearly $80... based on <br />
</p>
<p>the industry&#226;&#128;&#153;s current net-profit model.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More mind-boggling is the fact that this would be an outrageous <br />
</p>
<p>outcome for a stock now priced near 75 cents.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Would A 1,279% Gain Seem Like A Letdown To You?<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Tamm&#226;&#128;&#153;s journey to $80 a share would likely take six <br />
</p>
<p>or seven years. If you have that sort of vision, in just a <br />
</p>
<p>minute, I&#226;&#128;&#153;ll show you how TAMO should achieve this target.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, first, here&#226;&#128;&#153;s the good news for people who can&#226;&#128;&#153;t afford to <br />
</p>
<p>tie up capital for as long as it would take to claim a 8,709% <br />
</p>
<p>gain...<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#226;&#128;&#153;ll find that Tamm Oil and Gas&#226;&#128;&#153; near-future prospect &#226;&#128;&#147; with <br />
</p>
<p>a more reasonable stock-price goal &#226;&#128;&#147; is one that could offer <br />
</p>
<p>you solid rewards, as well.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you&#226;&#128;&#153;ll see, there&#226;&#128;&#153;s no real &#226;&#128;&#156;punishment&#226;&#128;&#157; in opting for <br />
</p>
<p>short-term over long-term... because conservative Swiss metrics <br />
</p>
<p>place TAMO&#226;&#128;&#153;s near-term share price in the $7.01 to $12.37 <br />
</p>
<p>range... price targets that could start you off with a nearly <br />
</p>
<p>670% gain and quickly expand to 1,279%.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even better, because Tamm Oil and Gas holds massive leases in <br />
</p>
<p>the Canadian oil sands, where the bitter winter has set in, <br />
</p>
<p>news of the report is just now gaining traction south of the <br />
</p>
<p>border where markets are made.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Tamm Oil and Gas (TAMO) The Implications Are Astounding...<br />
</p>
<p> The Multiples Appear Mind-boggling...<br />
</p>
<p> TAMO&#226;&#128;&#153;s Returns Could Stretch<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;From 670% To As High As 8,709%<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, here&#226;&#128;&#153;s what Tamm&#226;&#128;&#153;s new reality means to the company and, <br />
</p>
<p>just as importantly...<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it could mean for people who are able to get into TAMO <br />
</p>
<p>while its share price is still under $1.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Math Is As Staggering As The Profit Potential...<br />
</p>
<p> But Easy To Understand<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delivering 85,000 barrels of oil per day equates to slightly <br />
</p>
<p>more than 31 million barrels a year. And, as I write, oil sells <br />
</p>
<p>for near $81.51 a barrel... nearly twice the price it fetched a <br />
</p>
<p>year ago.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, let&#226;&#128;&#153;s remain conservative here.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The likely truth is that during the next three to four years, <br />
</p>
<p>oil will average about $75 a barrel... unless the U.S. or <br />
</p>
<p>Israel bombs Iran, then all bets are off as to how high oil <br />
</p>
<p>could fly.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, $75 a barrel is nothing to sneeze at. Because, at that <br />
</p>
<p>price, Tamm Oil and Gas would generate $2.36 billion a year in <br />
</p>
<p>revenue... that&#226;&#128;&#153;s right $2.36 BILLION... that equates to a <br />
</p>
<p>revenue projection of nearly $59 billion over the life of its <br />
</p>
<p>lease.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, because of the way huge numbers have been so casually <br />
</p>
<p>tossed around during the recession, recovery and bailouts, some <br />
</p>
<p>peoples&#226;&#128;&#153; views could be a bit skewed about what a billion <br />
</p>
<p>dollars really is...<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A billion is 10 times 100 million.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Secret To Unlocking Outlandish Gains Is Revealed<br />
</p>
<p> In Tamm Oil and Gas&#226;&#128;&#153; Stellar Revenue Projections <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, $590 million multiplied by 100 &#226;&#128;&#147; $59 billion in revenue &#226;&#128;&#147; <br />
</p>
<p>is where a conservative Swiss analyst, named Ernest Schlotter, <br />
</p>
<p>from SISM Research, thinks Tamm Oil and Gas could be headed... <br />
</p>
<p>based on and average price per barrel of $75.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is likely the minimum of what investors should expect from <br />
</p>
<p>Tamm Oil and Gas throughout the life of a project in the Peace <br />
</p>
<p>River Oil Sands Area of Alberta.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These revenue targets are the reason I&#226;&#128;&#153;ll show you, in just a <br />
</p>
<p>second, why it&#226;&#128;&#153;s only the slightest bit presumptuous to assume <br />
</p>
<p>that Tamm Oil and Gas could trade for nearly $80 a share.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, now that the big numbers are on the table... Tamm Oil and <br />
</p>
<p>Gas&#226;&#128;&#153; massive potential revealed... it is an excellent time to <br />
</p>
<p>be frank about a couple of facts here.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Pennies Are For Potential... Big Dollars Are For Reality<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, until recently Tamm Oil and Gas was but one in the <br />
</p>
<p>ubiquitous legion of tidy, well-run, but small oil and gas <br />
</p>
<p>outfits. You know, as it waited for its &#226;&#128;&#156;gusher&#226;&#128;&#157; moment to hit, <br />
</p>
<p>it was the kind you could buy on the stock market for pocket <br />
</p>
<p>change. Hit and hope!<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, TAMO will probably never again sell for pennies, but as <br />
</p>
<p>you&#226;&#128;&#153;re seeing, its price, at slightly under $1, represents a <br />
</p>
<p>huge mismatch compared to Tamm Oil and Gas&#226;&#128;&#153; newly discovered <br />
</p>
<p>potential...<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, I can feel you shaking your head. So, let&#226;&#128;&#153;s be honest.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, it seems impossible that a company sporting a 75-cent <br />
</p>
<p>stock could be on its way to selling 31 million barrels of oil <br />
</p>
<p>a year &#226;&#128;&#147; for $2.3 billion in annual revenues &#226;&#128;&#147; or that it could <br />
</p>
<p>even remotely justifies a whopping $79.21 share price, which is <br />
</p>
<p>the upper reaches of what I consider Tamm Oil and Gas&#226;&#128;&#153; range.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Over The Long Term, A Predicted Nearly<br />
</p>
<p> 700% Gain Could Be A Tasty Appetizer<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hear you.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, truth is, right now, for this brief moment in time, I <br />
</p>
<p>would have to agree with Schlotter, the Swiss analysts at <br />
</p>
<p>SISM.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his report, Schlotter writes that shares in Tamm Oil and Gas <br />
</p>
<p>could be headed for $7.01... that&#226;&#128;&#153;s based on his feeling that <br />
</p>
<p>TAMO has yet to prove itself as a steady producer... even as <br />
</p>
<p>its prospects are so bright.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, let me just clear my throat here, because Schlotter&#226;&#128;&#153;s <br />
</p>
<p>$7.01 target is &#226;&#128;&#147; ahem &#226;&#128;&#147; about 10 times more that what TAMO <br />
</p>
<p>trades for today.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, a nearly 700% gain is not the 8,709% extreme return I <br />
</p>
<p>see in TAMO's future... and, you know human nature, I guarantee <br />
</p>
<p>you one of my readers will haunt me forever if TAMO only goes <br />
</p>
<p>up about 700% or so and not to the promised-land 8,709%.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when you read down, you&#226;&#128;&#153;ll find there is a good case for <br />
</p>
<p>Tamm Oil and Gas (OTCBB:TAMO) to merge or be taken over at a <br />
</p>
<p>price around $12.37. That would represent about a 1,279% gain <br />
</p>
<p>from TAMO&#226;&#128;&#153;s current low price.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Global Marketplace... China&#226;&#128;&#153;s Thirst... Could Set The Price <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are solid, documented reasons to believe that Tamm Oil <br />
</p>
<p>and Gas is on a steady course to deliver you a sweet reward in <br />
</p>
<p>the $7.01 to $12.37 range.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That price will be driven by a simple global reality... the <br />
</p>
<p>developed world now extends well beyond the North America and <br />
</p>
<p>Europe.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and India, alone, are slurping up oil and gas rates never <br />
</p>
<p>before seen from new economies. Their middle-class populations <br />
</p>
<p>are exploding.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Chinese company now owns and builds Hummers... an Indian <br />
</p>
<p>corporation now owns Jaguar!<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the world of the 21st Century... someday we should <br />
</p>
<p>decide whether this is bad or good... but today, this reality <br />
</p>
<p>is the reason there are so many new and fertile ways to <br />
</p>
<p>dominate the stocks markets.<br />

<p>the TAMO opportunity... leave no stones unturned.<br />

<p> A Global Investing Authority Who Has<br />
</p>
<p> Actually Been Around The World<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Carpenter, editor of the Carpenter Global <br />
</p>
<p>Stock Advisory. I am so well known on the international <br />
</p>
<p>investment scene that The Wall Street Journal had this to say <br />
</p>
<p>in a huge feature it did on me&#226;&#128;&#166;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#226;&#128;&#156;Mr. Carpenter tends to focus on companies that fly below the <br />
</p>
<p>radar screens of most Wall Street analysts&#226;&#128;&#166;.&#226;&#128;&#157;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USA Today reported that the companies I discover have a knack <br />
</p>
<p>for blasting off.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Business Journal described my track record as remarkable. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#226;&#128;&#153;s just a sampling of the market-trouncing gains about <br />
</p>
<p>which the media was so excited:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> * Cosco Singapore (CSCMY.PK) up 562% in 22 months<br />
</p>
<p> * Chia Shin Cement (0669.HK) up 430.60% in 14 months<br />
</p>
<p> * NorthEast Petroleum ( AMEX: NEP) up 121.33% in 17 months<br />
</p>
<p> * General Steel Holdings (NYSE:GSI) up 670.86% in 32 months<br />
</p>
<p> * Lingo Media (OTCBB:LMDCF) up 141.6 in 38 months<br />
</p>
<p> * Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) up 148.88% in 12 months<br />
</p>
<p> * China Natural Gas (NASDAQ:CHNG) up 452% in 35 months<br />
</p>
<p> * Posco (NYSE:PKX) up 188.44 in 19 months<br />
</p>
<p> * Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE:YZC) up 472% in 15 months<br />
</p>
<p> * Xinyuan Real Estate (NYSE:XIN) up 87.61% in 11 months<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Respected Global Research<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, as you know, that&#226;&#128;&#153;s all yesterday&#226;&#128;&#153;s news.  As is the <br />
</p>
<p>fact that I founded Asia Business & Investing and to this day, <br />
</p>
<p>remain the only American journalist to write for the Mandarin <br />
</p>
<p>language Shanghai Security News, a daily paper that&#226;&#128;&#153;s <br />
</p>
<p>considered China&#226;&#128;&#153;s Wall Street Journal.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, while today is what counts, it&#226;&#128;&#153;s important for you to know <br />
</p>
<p>that as many people merely talk about global investing, I live <br />
</p>
<p>it.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, that&#226;&#128;&#153;s why you would be correct if you asked why I am <br />
</p>
<p>offering you my best research for FREE with no obligation. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is simple. I am convinced that the best way to pitch <br />
</p>
<p>you my new Carpenter Global Stock Advisory would be the profits <br />
</p>
<p>you could make on Tamm Oil And Gas (OTCBB: TAMO). <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more you know now about the company, the more confidence <br />
</p>
<p>you'll have in the integrity and depth of the research I put <br />
</p>
<p>into every recommendation.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let&#226;&#128;&#153;s get back on subject and dig a bit deeper, because&#226;&#128;&#166; <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Now, Tamm Oil and Gas (TAMO)<br />
</p>
<p> Looks To Be My Next Biggie!<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know, so far we&#226;&#128;&#153;ve only scratched the surface of the <br />
</p>
<p>logic supporting my prediction that Tamm Oil and Gas (TAMO) <br />
</p>
<p>could deliver you as much as 900% before long and, crazy as it <br />
</p>
<p>sounds, as much as 10,756% during the next seven years or so.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it is time to go deep and get down to the business of why <br />
</p>
<p>you should consider Tamm Oil and Gas (OTCBB:TAMO) 2010&#226;&#128;&#153;s best <br />
</p>
<p>energy sector opportunity... why you need to buy TAMO shares as <br />
</p>
<p>the market ASAP.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>information. It should be understood that there is no guarantee <br />
</p>
<p>past performance will be indicative of future results. Any <br />
</p>
<p>reference to past performance(s) of companies previously <br />
</p>
<p>advertised are specially selected to be referenced based on the <br />
</p>
<p>favorable performance of these companies and the companies <br />
</p>
<p>referenced may not be representative of all past advertised <br />
</p>
<p>companies as not all past advertised companies may have <br />
</p>
<p>performed as well. Readers are cautioned that small and <br />
</p>
<p>micro-cap stocks are high-risk investments and that they may <br />
</p>
<p>lose all or a portion of their investment if they make a <br />
</p>
<p>purchase in our advertised stocks. In order to be in full <br />
</p>
<p>compliance with the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), <br />
</p>
<p>we are receiving a total of two hundred fifty thousand dollars <br />
</p>
<p>U.S. from a third party as compensation for the distribution of <br />
</p>
<p>this and other advertisements. Since we are receiving <br />
</p>
<p>compensation and hold stock in the advertised company there is <br />
</p>
<p>an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions <br />
</p>
<p>and such statements and opinions cannot be considered <br />
</p>
<p>independent. We will benefit from any increase in share price <br />
</p>
<p>of the advertised company. We will sell our shares at any time, <br />
</p>
<p>without notice, be that before, during or immediately after the <br />
</p>
<p>release of this advertisement. The liquidation of our stock may <br />
</p>
<p>have a negative impact on the securities of the company <br />
</p>
<p>liquidated, including decreased market value and/or dilution of <br />
</p>
<p>the company's securities. Furthermore, our associates and/or <br />
</p>
<p>employees and/or principals may have stock positions in <br />
</p>
<p>advertised companies purchased in the open market or in private <br />
</p>
<p>transactions. These positions may be liquidated, without prior <br />
</p>
<p>notification, even after we have made positive comments <br />
</p>
<p>regarding the advertised company. It should be understood that <br />
</p>
<p>any price targets and/or projections mentioned are solely <br />
</p>
<p>opinions and should not be taken as suggested holding periods. <br />
</p>
<p>In fact, we will sell our positions in any companies advertised <br />
</p>
<p>before they reach such target prices. The receipt of this <br />
</p>
<p>information constitutes your acceptance of these terms and <br />
</p>
<p>conditions. Reading this advertisement shall not create under <br />
</p>
<p>any circumstances an offer to buy or sell stock in any company <br />
</p>
<p>advertised. Nor shall it create any principal-agent <br />
</p>
<p>relationship between the reader and us. The stocks of <br />
</p>
<p>advertised companies may trade in fast moving, highly volatile <br />
</p>
<p>markets, and any reader should observe the trading behavior of <br />
</p>
<p>any advertised company prior to investing. Advertised stocks <br />
</p>
<p>are often thinly traded and large sell orders will have a <br />
</p>
<p>substantially negative impact on share price. Investors in <br />
</p>
<p>advertised stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares <br />
</p>
<p>without seeing a decline in market price and may have <br />
</p>
<p>difficulty in finding ready buyers of their stock. Information <br />
</p>
<p>within this advertisement contains &quot;forward looking&quot; statements <br />
</p>
<p>within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities Act <br />
</p>
<p>of 1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act <br />
</p>
<p>of 1934. Any statements that express or involve discussions <br />
</p>
<p>with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, <br />
</p>
<p>projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future events or <br />
</p>
<p>performance are not statements of historical facts and may be <br />
</p>
<p>forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are <br />
</p>
<p>based on expectations, estimates and projections at the time <br />
</p>
<p>the statements are made that involve a number of risks and <br />
</p>
<p>uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to <br />
</p>
<p>differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward <br />
</p>
<p>looking statements may be identified through the use of words <br />
</p>
<p>such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates, believes, or by <br />
</p>
<p>statements indicating certain actions may, could or might <br />
</p>
<p>occur. We encourage our readers to invest carefully and read <br />
</p>
<p>the investor information available at the web sites of the U.S. <br />
</p>
