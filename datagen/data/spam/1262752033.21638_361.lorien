Hello ,
 
I am Dr.Abedi Williams , personal physician to a top politician, who recently passed away after a brief heart illness. Before his death, he  mandated me on his death bed to search for an honest foreigner who could invest his estate valued at US$17.5million.  I wish to place this fund in your care and trust you with the future and financial security of my client’s wife and children. Your main responsibility is to ensure the total evacuation/transfer of the funds from Ghana where it is secured at the moment to your country and to carry out viable investments on behalf of his wife and kids. If you are interested and in a position to secure this fund and to handle the investments on behalf of my client’s wife and kids, please notify me as a matter of urgency so that I can give you full details and then we can discuss your compensation / benefits among other things.  Please note that this transaction is confidential and should be treated as such. Early response will be highly appreciated.
 
 Best Regards,
 
Dr. Abedi Williams
