Beloved Friend,

I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great  
sorrow in my heart because my Doctor told me that I will die in three  
months time. Base on this development I want to will my money which is  
deposited in a security company. I am in search of a reliable person  
who will use the Money to build charity organization for the saints  
and the person will take 20% of the total sum. While 80% of the money  
will go to charity organization and helping the orphanage. I grew up  
as an Orphan and I don't have anybody/family member to take care of my  
wealth. The total money in question is $11.8million dollars. I will  
provide you with other information's once you indicate your willingness.


Yours sincerely.
Mrs. Bridget Leong
