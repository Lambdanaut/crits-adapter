Attn:  Honorable Contractor

         
                                                        SITUATION REPORT

This is to inform you that the Central Bank of Nigeria and Federal Government of Nigeria have mandated us to pay you by cash. This unconventional mode of payment was recommended by a team of World Bank Auditors and IMF invited by Federal Government of Nigeria owing to the delays and unnecessary demands of fees by CBN and there offshore paying bank Citibank, HSBC Bank, Halifax Bank and others including  Nigeria Commercial Banks. 

This will solve the problems of wire transfer or draft from CBN and other Banks which never materialize. Thus only US$10.5Million part-payment has been approved on the behalf as first install mental payment. Confirm you're nearest airport and safest address where this cash could be delivered, the cash is real and require no forward treatment.

This cash delivery is achieved by international diplomatic immunity, it is very important that you include your email address in your response. Fax and telephone because communications are sometimes difficult to remote areas. You are to pay for the delivery cost upon the receipt of confirmation of the consignment. I hope you have all the necessary documents require to back up these funds as maybe demand by any security agency.             

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,
