Attention Please,
I wish to use this medium to get in touch with you but do take your good ti=
me to go
through it, I am Mr. Haji Abubakar, Principal treasury officer with {I.I.B.=
S}. I have decided to contact you through this medium based on a business p=
roposal, which will be of mutual benefit to both of us.

Mr. Bernard Smith made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calenda=
r months, valued at US$ 7,450,000.00 (Seven Million Four Hundred and Fifty =
Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routi=
ne notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, =
we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, N=
ational Mining Corporation that Mr. Smith died from an automobile accident.=
 On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all=
 attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further=
 investigation and discovered that Mr. Smith did not declare any next of ki=
n in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.

This sum of (US$ 7,450,000.00) is still sitting in the Bank and the interes=
t is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No o=
ne will come forward to claim it. According to the Senegal Law, at the expi=
ration of 6{Six} years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Seneg=
al Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my propos=
al is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to=
 Mr. Bernard Smith so that this money will not be reverted by the governmen=
t.

If this request matches with your inward intention for success and greatnes=
s, then you are urged to make a quick response indicating your interest and=
 readiness to participate and work with me to make this successful. You can=
 contact me on the Private email. hajiabubakar30@yahoo.com

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transacti=
on would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your ass=
istance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.
Thanks and Regard
Mr. Haji Abubakar
