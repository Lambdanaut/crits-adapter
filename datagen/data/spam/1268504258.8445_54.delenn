Hello! How are you doing? I hope that at all of you well. I have met
yours profile and have decided to try to write to you. As you have
liked me. Probably you also have not paid to me such attention, as I
the usual and simple girl. But I would like to try to get acquainted
with you. Now I shall not write much about myself. Only I shall inform
the small information and I shall send some my photos. My name Elena or
is possible simply Lena, to me 30 years and live I in Russia. If you
will be interested in that to try to continue our acquaintance.

You can write that to me on mine email:  elena_ma@lavabit.com 

If you will answer me and acquaintance to me will be interesting to you. In
my following letter I already shall try to tell that more to you about
myself. That you had an opportunity to learn me little bit better.
Excuse that I write only in english but I still yet do not know in
what language for you it will be more convenient and easier to
communicate. And english is considered universal language in the
world. All the best to you. Will receive pleasantly and interestingly
your answer.

Elena
