for cancer
for about 2 years ago. I will be going in for an operation later  
today.I decided
to WILL/donate the sum of (Fourteen Millions Two Hundred Fifty Eight Thousand
United States Dollars) to you for the good work of the lord.

Contact my lawyer with this email: Name: Mr Jay Mchenry

Tell him that I have WILLED 14.258M to you by quoting my personal reference
number JJ/MMS/953/5015/GwrI/316us/uk. As soon as you contact him with this
details quoted above, he should be able to recognize you and help in claiming
this amount from my Bank.Be informed also that i have paid for the  
state tax on
this money to be transferred to you.

Meanwhile you are advised to keep this mail and it contents confidential as i
really want my wish accomplish at the end of the day.Please do pray to God for
my recovery.
