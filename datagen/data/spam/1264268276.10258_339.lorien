Dear friend,


I hope my email meets you well. I am in need of your assistance. My name is Sgt Perry Rice. I am in the Engineering military unit here in Ba'qubah in Iraq,we have some amount of funds that we want to move out of the country.My partners and I need a good partner someone we can trust. It is oil money and legal.


Basically since we are working for the government we cannot keep these funds, but we want to transfer and move the funds to you, so that you can keep it for us in your safe account or an offshore account. But we are moving it through Diplomatic means, to send it to your house directly or a bank of your choice using Diplomatic Courier Service.


The most important thing is that can we trust you? Once the funds get to you, you take your 30% out and keep our own 70%. Your own part of this deal is to find a safe place where the funds can be sent to. Our own part is sending it to you.If you are interested i will furnish you with more details.


But the whole process is simple and we must keep a low profile at all times. Waiting for your urgent response via my private email: perry_rice222@yahoo.com.hk
perry.rice9876@gmail.com


This business is risk free.


Regards,
Sgt Perry Rice.
