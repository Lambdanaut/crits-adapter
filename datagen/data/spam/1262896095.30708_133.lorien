<DIV>
<FONT color=#000000>In order to assist me and my only brother Ousman Conte whom is in prison now in Guinea, I want to repatriate the funds valued at {US$20 Million} left behind in a security company by my late father before it gets confiscated by the present military government who have seized power through a bloodless military coup d'etat led by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara and other junior officers in the Guinea Military.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=#000000>Presently, they have placed embargo on my late fathers assets during Captain Moussa Dadis</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>

<FONT color=#000000>Meanwhile, my late father has some of his fortunes in my care particularly these sums valued at</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=#000000>{US$20 Million} available for investment with a security company, which I will disclose to you once I receive your mail. In the interim, my aim and objective is to safely repatriate the funds out of the country and afterwards seek for profitable investment opportunity which you will be the arrow head and guidance of the business enterprise in your country under partnership between your company and me, pending my arrival in your country. </FONT></DIV>

<DIV>
<FONT color=#000000>Preferably I will appreciate dealing directly with legitimate owners of the company or an individual who had vast experience in the investment and business circle and has the capability to handle our project rather than brokers or middlemen. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=#000000>Therefore, I would like to request your full contact details, where I can reach the Chief Executive Officer of your organization to enable them discuss further details on this and how to make this a reality in due course.</FONT></DIV>
