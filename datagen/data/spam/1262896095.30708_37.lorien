Dearest Friend,


Happy new year and how are you doing today? Hope all is well with you and your family? I know that this letter will come to you as a surprise as we don't know ourselves before, but be rest assured that it is real and a genuine business. I am Mr. Matthew Craig I am an account officer to Mr.Rafik Hariri, Born in Lebanon in 1944, And the Late Rafik Hariri was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon. You can view this website for confirmation.

I got your mail through my private search and out of Desperation I decided to reach you through this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused; I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private.

 

Mr.Rafik Hariri deposit £22,759,000.00(TWENTY TWO MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND BRITISH POUNDS STERLING) here in United Kingdom, This account has not been operated for the past three years now, because no family members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds.

 

Since then I have made several inquires to locate any of Mr.Rafik Hariri extended relatives but this has proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I have decided to invest this money in your country, the need to move out this money arose when the Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that some of the money held in dormant accounts would be used to fund youth and community projects for you can confirm this in the website below.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regard. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-

 

(1) Can I completely trust you?

(2) I am ready to offer you 35% of this (£22,759,000.00) I hope it is acceptable by you? And 5% will be for any expenses both parties incurred in the process of this business and the remaining 60% will be for me,

 

If you can not do these businesses, kindly discard or disregard the mail.

 

Best Regards

Mr. Matthew Craig.
