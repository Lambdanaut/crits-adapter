Dear Friend,

My name is Sally Sailway and i am  18 years old. I have sent you this email because i would like you to be my partner in a business proposal.

My father,  Mr. Sailway, left me a huge sum in his major account with First City Monument Bank (FCMB) before his death early this year with a clause in his will, that states that i cannot not have access to the funds until i am 25 years old, unless i  provide the bank with a guardian, who would make claim of the funds on my behalf. The account holds a balance of 10,000,000USD(Ten Million United States Dollars),  and i am willing to provide you with full access to the funds, including the username and password with which you can access the account online(via the internet). Also, i will provide you with the banks email address and telephone number, so you can verify the details.

Furthermore, i would like to inform you that if you agree to be my partner, i will split the funds with you 50/50 as soon as the fund is released and transfered to you. I must also inform you that in order to facilitate the release and acquire the fund, we would be required to pay certain fees which are the COT (Cost of transfer) and TAX Clearance fee; Which I am willing to pay half of each fee and you would be required to pay the balance .

Please get back to me with the details below if you agree to this proposal;
