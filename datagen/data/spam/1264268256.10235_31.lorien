http://cid-902963972297d0b2.spaces.live.comGood evening,  Andrew!That isn=
't much of a wedding present. That is nothing. This I must. Ask Pilar for=
 it. So does Fernando. They took his trail. We have fine people there.Rob=
ert Jordan felt in the other sack. But I hate it. See that you are not se=
en. It was an old armored car. Is there an alarm? Oh damn the dirty swine=
 to hell. It was not that way at all. If not before. You have no need to =
hurt me. It was they who did it.But let's have another one! The melon of =
Valencia for eating. All the dignity that one could have. It must be done=
 smartly. That is Valencia. Is that not so? No case of assault and batter=
y? If they would come for this business. What are you after in these part=
s?Answer me that? We are late. We had two with a machine gun. What we did=
 Some one came toward where they stood. But the bridges are guarded. It =
shouldn't have happened. That is what we cannot have.
