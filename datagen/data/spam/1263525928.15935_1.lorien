Or to brave a laugh. That is what I mean by saying that men and boys are
cowards. You will let the worst fellow of the lot be the leader and give
the tone to conversation because you have not the pluck to say boldly
that it is wrong, and that you will not join in it. This want of moral
courage makes a lad give up little by little his hold on what is right.
Sunday school, Church-going, prayers given up because Jem chaffs so
about them. If he chooses to neglect them that is his look out. You have
as much right to your opinion as he has to his. Why should you let him
show more courage in doing wrong than you in doing right. Are you afraid
of him? No. Well then, stick to your duty. I said just now that going to
work throws you in with a different set of companions. Here, specially,
comes the test of your courage. Are you going to follow bad leaders, or
have you the courage of your own opinions. There is one particular
subject where courage is most needed, and where it most often fails. A
young lad naturally wants to seem to be manly--has a sort of feeling
that he would like to show that he is not just a little boy and bound to
do as he is told. He is tempted to show his manliness by neglect of home
commands, rough and rude manners, bad language and bad talk. I have
remarked before how home obedience and true manliness go together; here
I want to speak more particularly about bad language and bad talking,
and the evil it leads to. S. Paul speaks about it very plainly when he
says, speaking of the things that should not be named amongst
Christians, "neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting, which
are not convenient." Now, boys, all indecent words and conversations are
wrong--they are sinful, unmanly, degrading. I know you cannot help
hearing much that is wrong. Shame, be it said, to the men of
England--yes, men who talk of advancement an
