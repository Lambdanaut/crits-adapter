yo mate, ok I`ll give you my trick but if you give it someone else I`ll fuckin kill you :)
you know in roulette you can bet on blacks or reds. If you bet $1 on black and it goes black you win $1 but if it goes red you loose your $1.
but I found a way you can win everytime:

bet $1 on black if it goes black you win $1

now again bet $1 on black, if this time it goes red (or one of 2 green fields) bet $3 on black, if it goes red again bet $8 on black, if red again bet $20 on black, red again bet $52 on black (always multiple you previous lost bet around 2.5), if now is black you win $52 so you have $104 and you bet:

$1 + $3 + $8 + $20 + $52 = $84 and you won $52 + yours $52 = $104 So you just won $20 :)

now when you won you start with $1 on blacks again etc etc. its always bound to go black eventually (it`s around 50/50 and you always bet around 2.5, I never had more then 7 reds/green in the raw and possibility to have 9 times the same color is like 1/milion) so that way you eventually always win. But there`s a catch: if you start winning too much (like $1000 a day) casino will finally notice something and they can ban 
you. I was banned once on royal casino. So don`t be a greedy asshole and don`t win more then $300 a day and you can do it for years. And remember it`s not a "win 30k in one day" trick, it`s a way to get a steady income of around 5-8k bucks a month for a next couple of years tax free :). I think bigger casinos know that trick so I only play on smaller ones, right now I play on gold vip casino: www.goldviptables.com for around 
6 months, I win $100-$200 (max $300) a day and my account still works, I already made almost 45k in that casino and hope to make much much more. You just have to download casino games, register and you can start, you`ll find roulette there when you log in go to "specialty games". And don`t you dare talling about it anyone else, if too many people knows about it casinos will finally found a way to block that trick. If you have any questions just drop me a line here or on skype.

c ya
