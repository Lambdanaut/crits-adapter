                                       LETTER OF BUSINESS PROPOSAL 

Dear friend,


Compliment of the season. Note: Before you proceed reading this mail, this is true and not one of those mails you see on the internet, I am about to retire and here in Africa service is not adequately rewarded I tell you the gospel truth, hence do not blame me on this, I only need you to help me so that we can smile in future, GOD bless you as you read.

I presume this mail will not be a surprise to you. I am an accountant in the mineral commission department of Ministry of Mines and Energy Ghana and also a member of contracts awarding committee of this ministry under Ghana government. I got your full information from Chamber of Commerce and industry on foreign business relations here in Accra-Ghana. And I believed you must be trustworthy and honest person main looking at your profile.


Some years ago, Ghana government asked this committee to awards contracts to foreign firms, which I and my colleagues happened to be the head of this committee. With our good position, this contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$10,500,000:00 as a deal to be benefited by the two Members of this committee. Now the contracts value has been paid off to the actual contractors that executed these jobs, all we want now is a trusted foreign partner like you that we shall front with her banking account number to Claim the over inflated sum.


The said funds will be shared within us when it is confirmed into your provided Account in your country by the paying Bank. 


NOTE: I know there may be scams and junk mails flying here and there on the internet but certainly, this is not one. Please do not fail to understand that in spite of all that, opportunities of this kind still abound. If you have ever wished or prayed for something good to come your way, now I urge you to take this message seriously and with an open mind.


You could never know. This may be an answer to your prayers. So please give it a benefit of doubt and with good faith and trust join me and I am assuring you now that you will never be disappointed. Kindly respond back to me.


Regards,


Dr. Jeremy Yeboah.
