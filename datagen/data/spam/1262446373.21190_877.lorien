CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below. I know a deal of this magnitude will make anyone worried and apprehensive, but I am assuring you not, as all will be well at the end of this endeavor.
 
I am Donald Schummer, Esq. (Barrister), a Solicitor at Law, the Personal Attorney to a Late. Mr. Nicholas P. Che II, a foreign expatriate who hails from your country. On the 4th of July 2001, it was reported to us, that my client, while returning from Vacation with his family from Russia, all died in the Tupolev-154 crash leaving from Black Sea holiday resort of Anapa to St.Petersburg for more information about this crash and people, visit this  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5274958.stm
 
Particularly, the Bank has given me a mandate as his attorney; to provide his next of kin or the funds (in excess of 6.2 Million US Dollars) will be revoked within the next 15 working days. Hence the reason I establish contact with you to assist me by standing as his Next of kin so that the proceeds of his account will be transferred to you. 
 
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 4years now, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin of the deceased since you are a foreigner. You will be remunerated with 40% of the total funds for your assistance. If affirmative, kindly furnish me with your following details,

* Your Full Names, 
* Residential/Office Address, 
* Telephone / Fax Numbers,
 Age, 
 Occupation
 Marital Status, 

so that I will commence in the securing of all the legal documents to put you in place as the heir to my late clients estate. 
 
Donald Schummer, Esq. (Barr.)
Legal Practitioner & Solicitor.
