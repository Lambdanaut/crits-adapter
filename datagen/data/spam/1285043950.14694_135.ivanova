FROM THE DESK OF MR MOHAM MANASERRA.
FOREIGN REMMITANCE AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
LOME TOGO.
TEL:00228-9124789
 
Urgent Attention,
 

I have a proposal for you - this however is not mandatory nor will I in
any manner compel you to honour against your will.I am 50, and work with a
bank (one of the West African leading banks in the African Region). Here in this
bank existed
a dormant account for the past 8 years which belong to a
American national who is now late Mr.Raymond Beck Mrs. Dorene Beck who
died on Egypt Air Flight 990
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm
 
When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from
this account for this long period, I decided to carry out a system
investigation and discovered that non of the family member nor relations
of the late person is aware of this account.This is the story in a
nutshell. Now I want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this
funds.
 
Thereafter, I had planned to destroy all related documents for this
account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months I have
worked out everything to ensure a hitch -free operation.
 
The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated
interest the balance in this account stands at-(9.5 million US
Dollars).

Now My questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. What will be your commission?If you can sponsor this transfer Consider
this and get back at us as soon as possible.
 
Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information as contained herein
be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it
deserves. I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this project.
 
Call me at this direct line TEL:+ 00228-9124789 after sending a mail for
confirmation.
 
Respectfully yours,
 
Mr Moham Manaserra.
