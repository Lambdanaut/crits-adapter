Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Mbano Wanaga a Zimbabwean citizen presently taking refugee in GHANA. Due to crises in my country coupled with the assassination of my late father Mr. Desmond Wanaga. Who was killed by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE war veteran association who are calling for the white collection of farm land from all white settlers which is wrong.My father due to his stand over these issues fell out with the ruling party of PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE. Now my mother and my kid sister had to flee from our country to find refuge here in GHANA.Before the death of my father he was a major dealer of Diamond and Merchandise.He secretly moved these funds acquired from various sales in two trunk-boxes and deposited it in a security company in Ghana.

But at the time of deposit he told the security company that it is family valuables that are contained in the boxes. The total amount contained in the two boxes is $20 MILLION USD. Unknowingly to the security company.Please I want you to know that when my father heard of the plot by ROBERT MUGABE to kill him, he instructed the security company in Ghana to move the boxes containing the money to AMERICA by DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICE. But unfortunately my father could not escape out of ZIMBABWE; he was eventually killed, though he could not claim the boxes before his untimely death.The boxes is presently in AMERICA under the care of the DIPLOMAT that moved it to AMERICA but the DIPLOMAT or the CUSTOMS don’t know that it's money that is in the boxes. We have all the vital documents with  us, We need a trust worthy God fearing and experience person that will help us to invest this money in his country and take us as one family and will also buy a house for us over there where we !
can live safely.
