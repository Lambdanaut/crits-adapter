Dearest,
I am Mr. Micheal John, writing to inform you of our desire to invest in your country on behalf of Princess Haya Sheikh of Saudi Arabia.
Considering her very strategic and influential position, she hopes that the transaction is strictly confidential as possible. Also, want to disclose her identity at least
for now, until the completion of the transaction.
Hence our desire to have you as our agent abroad to protect and invest her funds in a profitable
business.
I have therefore been directed to investigate whether you would agree to act as a foreign agent in order to update this transaction.
If you can handle this, then you can come back to me via email.
 
Regards.
 
Mr.Micheal John.
