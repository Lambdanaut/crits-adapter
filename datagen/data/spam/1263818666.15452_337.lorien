                      Dear customer,

Please be so kind and review our Laboratory Glassware offer below:

                  Brief Export Proposal

Our area of interest is quality Borosilicate
3.3 Glassware at the lowest prices.

The capabilities listed below show the advantages
obtained by the many companies we worked for.

We would like you to send us your specific inquiry/offering demand.

This will give us the chance to prove our efficiency.

We are a young and aggressive company, determined in making
a name for us, especially on the European market.

We are experienced in distribution of high-quality
borosilicate 3.3 glassware manufactured in China,
under our supervision and brand-mark, according to 
the 9001 and 14001 ISO standards.

Our range of products includes:

Laboratory Glassware

Petri dishes
Slides and cover glasses
Specimen Jars
Reagent bottles
Beakers
Erlenmeyer Flasks
Boiling flasks
Desiccators
Dropping bottles
Measuring cylinders and measuring pipettes
Volumetric flasks
Burettes

and also

Laboratory ceramics.

All our glassware is high-quality 3.3 Borosilicate Glass.

Chemical properties:

The chemical resistance of our glassware is very high even
after long exposure times and temperatures above 100C.

Our glassware has very high resistance to attack by water, neutral
and acid salt solutions, strong acids and mixtures thereof,
and also chlorine, bromine, iodine and organic substances. 

Physical properties:

Temperature resistance on being heated
up and thermal shock resistance.

The maximum permissible operating temperature for glassware is 500C.
Our glassware has a high resistance to thermal shock.

As the thermal expansion coefficient of Borosilicate glass is low,
the thermal stress is under a given temperature gradient are
consequently low and the glass can withstand higher temperature
gradients and also sudden temperature changes/thermal shocks.

Temperature resistance at freezing temperatures:

Our glassware can be cooled down to the
maximum possible negative temperature. 

That means that it is also suitable
for use in liquid air (approx. -192C). 

Use in the microwave:

Borosilicate glassware is suitable for use in microwaves.

Optical properties:

Our glassware exhibits no significant absorption
in the visible range of the spectrum. 

This means that the appearance of the glassware is clear and colorless.

In the approx. 310-2200nm range of the 
spectrum the absorption is negligibly low.  

Please don't hesitate to contact us regarding any further
information on our production capabilities according to
the specific needs of your market.

You'll find out that our offer is far ahead the best in business.
