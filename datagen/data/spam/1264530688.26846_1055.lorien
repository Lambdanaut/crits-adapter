Dear Friend,

URGENT INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP IN YOUR COUNTRY.

I humbly wish to use this medium to draw your attention for an investment in Real Estate in your country. My names are Mr. Emanuel Johnson and I am the chief accountant to the above mentioned company (CONTINENTAL EXPRESS TRANSPORT LTD)here in London ,England. I have worked for the above mentioned company for 25 years. Iam a british citizen.
 
I sincerely seek your permision to be included in my investment scheme as my international ally,aiding me in investing the total sum of thirty eight million United States Dollars into Real Estate, which will take place in your country. This total sum was realised in the over invoiced bill of road construction contract that was awarded to my company at the time when Tony Blair was the british prime minister, And these funds were lodged in an unknown company account in a bank in Europe . 
 
My late manager whose name i will not disclose for security reason conspired with me to divert this funds for our personal use after retirement from active service. He used his viable position to create a secreet account for the company in a bank in Europe, and we are the only people in the company that are aware of the account where this funds were lodged. Now that my manager is dead, It is almost impossible for me to claim the funds we have toiled for over the years. Claiming the funds alone will attract series of queries and suspicions on my side as i may not be able to defend the source of the funds. Secondly, there is also a limit to what we earn as civil servants in England perharps the reason am asking for your assistance.
 
My proposition is for you to be posed as an international contractor that aided our company in the road construction awaiting payment.I.e We owe you some money from the contract you executed for us.I will use my position as the accountant of the company to help you claim this funds from the bank by backing you up with neccessary legal paper work that will automatically make you a contractor with our company which will help you to claim the funds without any hitch.
 
As soon as this funds hits your account, I shall be meeting you for onward disbursement in your country where i will use my own share of the funds in investing in Real Estate or preferably, we can form a joint venture for ourselves. I hope you have an idea of Real Estate? Conclusively, I have agreed to offer you 40% of the total sum while 60% is for me.

If you are interested, kindly get back to me with your complete information below; your direct telephone and fax numbers, mobile phone number, your occupation, your age, your home/office address. 

I look forward to hearing from you .
 
Respectfully yours.

Mr. Emanuel Johnson
