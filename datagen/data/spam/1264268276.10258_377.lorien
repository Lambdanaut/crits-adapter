<FONT size=2 color=#000000 face="Gautami">I am Mr. Martin Johnson the marketing manager (Greater London Regional Office) from Harlsden, North West London - England. I work for Natwest Bank and I am sending you this mail through the internet with reservations, basically you may perceive my intentions wrongly because a message like these could make anyone apprehensive considering the fact that you do not know me in person; especially at this time when people are self-conscious due to the news that overflows 
with scams, money laundering and grotesque events around the world.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=2 color=#000000 face="Gautami">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=2 color=#000000 face="Gautami">The issue I want to unravel to you is very classified and confidential. It involves a huge sum of money from a foreign deceased customer deposited here in the Bank where I work. The choice of contacting you is aroused from the geographical nature of where you live, particularly due to the sensivity of the transaction and the confidentiality herein. Since the death of our customer none of his relation has come forward to claim his money in our bank as the next of ki
n and our bank will not release the money unless someone applies for claim. However, I would like to seek your permission to have you stand as the family representative to retrieve the funds into your account because the British banking policy and guideline stipulates that any funds belonging to a deceased person for a period of 5years will be transferred into the Bank treasury as an unclaimed debt.</FONT></DIV>

Please if you are willing to accept my proposal kindly reply my mail by indicating your interest. Thereafter percentages and more information will be relayed to you on my next mail.</FONT></DIV>
