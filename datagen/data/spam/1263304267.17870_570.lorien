My Friend

The deal is concerning my late client who has similar last name with you an=
d who hails from your country.This client died leaving the sum of $16 milli=
on dollars with our bank,and since then the bank is worried about the fund =
and the bank has asked me (as the account manager to the late customer)to f=
ind any relation of the late customer for claim of the fund. But I know tha=
t the late customer(Engr.) died with all his immediate family as a result o=
f the incident.This is why I have to conduct a search over the internet to =
see if I can get some one(worthy) with similar names so that I will present=
 him to the bank=A0as the late customers next of kin to enable us claim the=
 $16 million. So,I have contacted you because the bank board=A0 have issued=
 me a notice to provide the next of kin of the deceased customer or the ban=
k will declare the account unservisable and confiscate the funds to the ban=
k treasury.
=A0
Because I would not want the bank to confiscate the fund and since I have b=
een unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over last 6 years now, I wan=
t to seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the late custom=
er , so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($16.million US dollars=
) can be paid to you as the late Engineer's next of kin . After the success=
ful transfer=A0 I and you will=A0 share the money when I come to your count=
ry.=20
All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal throug=
h. I guarantee that this deal will be executed under all legitimate arrange=
ment that will protect us=A0 from any breach of the law.=A0I am not contact=
ing because you know or you are related to this late Engineer,hence you are=
 aware that all my efforts to locate any direct family member of the late E=
ngineer proved unsucessful for the past years,and this is why I have contac=
ted you to carry on the deal with you(Hope you understand better now?).=A0I=
 want to assure you that I did not just wake up and decide to do this, I ha=
ve did my proper home work before contacting you and I want to asure you th=
at this is not a joke. I work with Bank Atlantique Abidjan C=F4te d Ivoire,=
 I am presently the director of Audit & records of my bank. I have worked w=
ith this bank for more than 10yrs now and I want to assure you that if I am=
 not sure that this deal will work, I would not have thought of doing it
 nor contacting you.
=A0
You should go ahead and send your information/datas(ie:your full names, add=
ress, date of birth, telephone and fax numbers) When I receive the informat=
ion ,I will work on the original=A0 account file of the deceased customer t=
o=A0 fill your=A0datas as the new next of kin and thereafter forward you an=
 application form which you will send to our bank officially for the claims=
