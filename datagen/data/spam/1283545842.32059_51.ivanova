Hello Man,

I don't know how to say it, but I've tryed before a long time to send you some photos, but I've thought that you aren't interested to see me.
But now I'm going to send you the Photos in the Attachment.
Download the pictures and extract they, I'm sure that you will like they. The password is: 123456

Have a great day.
