 I am a senior staff with a Financial House here in Spain, I on behalf of my colleagues need your assistance in 
repatriating some funds left behind by a late customer that died before it is declared unserviceable within the 
next 30 days. We decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction .Every attempt to trace any 
member of his family has proved unsuccessful and abortive. Actually this transaction is real and one hundred 
percent risk free and does not relate to any breach of law. I will give you more information upon your response 
to this proposal, to my personal Email address.  Email: bossmail@terra.es.
 
Best Regards,
Mr. D Pratt
