Dear Friend.
 
How are you doing today? I pray this mail get to you in Good health condition as I tell you this Good News.
 
I am Mr. James Cole. I am a US citizen, 48 years Old. I reside here in New Braunfels Texas 78132. My residential address is as follows. 108 Crockett Court. Apt 303, New Braunfels Texas, United States, am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $92,000.00 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail.
 
So I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my compensation documents, and I was directed to meet Mr. Udu Martins, who is the member of COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake. He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment.  Right now I am the happiest MAN on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $10.5Million 
 
Moreover, Mr. Udu Martins showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to email you, for you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.

I will advise you to contact Mr. Udu Martins; you have to contact him directly on this information below.
 
COMPENSATION AWARD HOUSE
Name: Mr. Udu Martins
Email: mr.udumartins@live.com
 
You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. Note that the only money I paid after I meet Mr. Udu Martins was just $180 for the paper works, take note of that.
 
Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Mr. Udu Martins, so that he can help you to deliver your fund instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.
 
Thank You and Be Blessed.
Mr. James Cole
