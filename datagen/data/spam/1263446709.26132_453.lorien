Greetings,  

I am Barrister Mark Duke.I am reaching out to you as regards the handling of an investment portfolio.  

I am soliciting your assistance in repatriating the funds and property left behind by my late client before it is confiscated by the government and declared unserviceable by the bank where the huge deposit is lodged. 

My Client died intestate and every attempt to trace any member of his family has proved unsuccessful and abortive. Do note that your identity or country of origin does not matter.  

I will give you more information upon your response. You should respond by sending the following:  

1. Your full names 

2. Tel & fax numbers

3. Complete Address 

4.Your occupation and your Age 

If Interested Please Reply me Via my PrivateEmail:markdukeesq200800@yahoo.com.hk

I humbly look forward to your soonest response. 

Yours Faithfully,
Barrister Mark Duke.
London, U.K
