Dear Friend,

First, I must apologize in advance if the contents of this email do not
meet with your approval, I humbly crave your indulgence.
My name is Jim Ovia, I am a South African, I am also an accountant by
profession. I recently retired as the accountant to the South African 2010
World Cup Local Organizing Committee. In my capacity as the accountant, I
came across a lot of foreign busineesmen seeking contracts for the
building of stadia and residential housing units for the participants of
the coming world cup.
I was courted by these foreign businessmen to help them secure contracts.
I did not in anyway compromise my integrity or position. I only rendered
help when it was convenient for me.  I amassed a lot of goodwill and since
my retirement, many contractors have approached me with the aims of
showing appreciation for the favor I rendered to them while in office.

These appreciations have been in form of money.  I need a proxy to collect
this money for me, hence this proposal to you. This transaction does not
require any financial commitment of any sort from you. All you need to do
is to collect this fund on our behalf and I will reward you handsomely.I
can be reached via email for more details. Like I stated earlier, this
transaction does not require any financial commitment from you and also
note that I did not solicit for this fund, hence this does not constitute
a bribe.Should this you are interested in this proposal, please furnish me
with the following information to enable me commence the paperwork for the
successful execution of this project.

NAME AND ADDRESS:

PRESENT OCCUPATION.

TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER.

I await your response if you are interested through this email address
jimoviayes147@live.com

Thank you.


Jim Ovia
