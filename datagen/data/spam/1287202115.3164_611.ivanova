Acknowledge,

I would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret, 
delete it if you are not interested and get back to me 
if you are interested  for details as regards to the transfer 
of $6,500,000.00 to you. This money initially belongs to
a client who died and had no next of kin in his account-opening
package. Most importantly, I will require a confirmation of 
acceptance from you after which I shall furnish you with the 
full details of this transaction

Regards,
Mr Wong Tang.
