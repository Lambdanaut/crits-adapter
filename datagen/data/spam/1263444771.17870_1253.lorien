RE: CODE OF CONDUCT ATM 990

I am Senator Idris Mantu from Nigeria, Chairman Senate Committee on
Foreign Debt Reconcilliation.

We received instruction from the Federal Government of Nigeria in
affiliation with WORLD BANK that have agreed to compensate all SCAMMED
VICTIMS from any part of the world with the average sum of $500,000 (Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollar Only), for self support depending on
the amount lost in the act. This is regarding the draws organized lately
to help individuals/organisation whom have lost their earnings in this act

We advise that you should forward the following information NAME, ADDRESS,
PHONE/FAX NUMBER, AGE, SEX and OCCUPATION for the processing and
programming of your payment into an ATM VISA CORPORATE CARD.

Always remember our code of conduct, which is (ATM - 990), so you have to
indicate this code when contacting us by using it as your subject because
of scammer. A scanned copy of the ATM CARD will be send to you prior the
postage of the original immediately all due process is completed.

Waiting for your response.

Sincerely,


Senator Idris Mantu
Foreign Debt Reconcilliation.
