Dear Sir/Madam, 

Do permit me to introduce myself briefly; I am Mr.Ray Nadel a legal attorney to Late Erickson Cowell Stallman a business and property magnate who died of a heart-related condition after the unfortunate sad news of his wife and their only daughter tragic death in the Madrid Bomb Blast on March 11,2004. 
 
Actually, I got your contact information through my private web search for someone I can confidently trust on and I believe we can transact this business, I have prayed over it and as trust worthy person I can confide on and I must not hesitate to confide in you for this simple and sincere request.
 
Prior to my explaining further, I am conscious that this is certainly not a predictable way of approach to foster a relationship of trust but because of the circumstances and urgency surrounding this claim I decided to reach you via this medium to join me to put claims on this deposited fund before it is seized or confiscated by the authorities. 
 
Before the catastrophe; He deposited the sum of €8,000,000.00 (Eight Million Euros Only) with a Bank here in Spain. As the attorney to the deceased, the bank has mandated me to present his next of kin/Beneficiary to make Claims of the fund, or the deposited fund will be confiscated or declared as unclaimed fund. I was given an ultimatum to look for some relative/next of kin to come for the claim or have the funds liquidated and made unserviceable in accordance with 
existing laws. 
 
After preliminary efforts of search for a direct family member which came to no avail, I decided to contact you, my suggestion to you is that I will like to present you as the beneficiary to this fund, I know you may not be anyway related to my late client; Hence I am presenting you as the next of kin is a possibility that the Deposited fund will be released to you. I can guarantee that if you are willing and interested I will put in place all necessary modality in accordance with the Law to legally present you as the true Next of Kin and true beneficiary. We can share the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documents to back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided. 
 
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from many breach of the law. If this business proposition offends your moral values, do accept my apology. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinary confidential, whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Please contact me at once to indicate your interest. 
 
I will like you to acknowledge the receipt of this e-mail as soon as possible via E-mail :(robertkal@bk.ru) and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.
 
Best regards, 
Mr.Ray Nadel (Esq)
Attorney at Law.
