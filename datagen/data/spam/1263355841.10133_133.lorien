Dear Friend, 

This is to bring to your notice that I have paid the re-activation fee and the delivery of your ATM Card. I paid it because the ATM Card  worth of $1.5m has less than Seven days to expire and when it expires, the money will go into Federal Government treasury account. With that I decided to help you pay off the money so that the ATM Card will not expire, because I trust that when you receive your ATM Card definitely you must pay me back my money and even compensate me for helping you. 

Now i want you to contact Efex Express Courier Service with your residential or office address where you will preffer the delivery to be delivered so that they can deliver your Card to your designated address without any delay. Like i stated earlier, The delivery charges has been paid but i did not pay their official keeping fees since they refused. They refused and the reason is that they do not know when you are going to contact them and the dumurrage might have increased because their security keeping charges counts per day.They told me that their keeping fees is $25 per day while i deposited it on Saturday last week so contact them immediately to avoid paying much fee. 

Below is their Contact Informations,
 
Contact Person: Mr.James Morre.

Best Regards. 
Mr Steven Bill
