Hello,
 
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to write you this mail and even when it might come to you as a surprise. I hope you find it of interest.
 
My name is Paul Kunert. I am client services manager with a Bank here in Europe. I would like to use this means to ask your assistance in moving some funds over to your country.
 
I have in the course of my duties come in contact with some funds that have been inactive for some years now and careful investigation proved the original depositor of the funds died five years ago. 
 
All attempts to reach the supposed beneficiary of the deposit were fruitless and before it is forfeited to the state, I will like to move it outside now and this is were I need your assistance.
 
I look forward to hearing from you and my gratitude for your patience
 
Respectfully yours
 
Paul Kunert
