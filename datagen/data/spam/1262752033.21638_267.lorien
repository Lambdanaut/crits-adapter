Urgent Attention,

I have a proposal for you - this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honor against your will. I am 50, and work with a bank (one of the African leading banks in the West Africa). Here in this bank existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which belong to a American national who is now late Mr.Mark Ostler who died on Egypt Air Flight 990 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm

When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from this account for this long period, I decided to carry out a system investigation and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late person is aware of this account.This is the story in a nutshell. Now I want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this funds.

Thereafter, I had planned to destroy all related documents for this account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months I have worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account stands at-(US$ 9.5 million US dollars).

Now our questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. What will be your commission?

If you can sponsor this transfer Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible. Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this project. Call me at this direct line +2348065093001 after sending a mail for confirmation.

Respectfully yours,

Mr Fred Adams.
