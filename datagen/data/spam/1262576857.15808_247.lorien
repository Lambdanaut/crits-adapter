Greetings!

With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this proposal believing that it will receive the most desired attention from you even as we have not had any previous correspondence, Although, I am constrained by insufficient information about you, but I will express in full the main objectives of this proposal.

I am a personal attorney to late Engineer Mr. John McKnight, from your country who used to work with shell petrol chemical and Development Company in South Africa, Herein after shall be referred to as my client. On the 21st of April 2005, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Cape Town express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. 

Since then I have made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this has proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged, particularly the bank in South Africa where the deceased had an account valued at about $13.2 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated after five years if not claimed.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 4 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased. So that the proceeds of this account valued at $13.2 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and i can share the money. We can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. And these I must do to make sure that this transition is not wasted or end up in the wrong hands. 

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. 

If you can be fast, this Transfer can be concluded under 10 banking days but you should keep the business to yourself You should not tell your bank that money is coming to your account because they may ask you questions that you may not be able to answer. I will tell you what and when to tell your bank with all the necessary document to back the source and origin of the fund as legitimate fund that do not originate from drug or money laundry.

Remember to include your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers for easy communication or you can call me for more clarifications +27785063906.
 
Yours faithfully,
Barrister Micheal Miller.
