Attention: Fund Beneficiary,

We, the entire members of the Federal House of Senate, on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, under the auspices of the new civilian Head of State(President Umaru Musa Yar'adua), held a meeting last two days with Stake Holders concerning all Overdue Payment's. The meeting held was prior to the Call for Justice by the UN, US and so many other International Communities and was focused on finding a Lasting solution to all delayed payment, both foreign and local contractors and some inheritance funds.

Having reached swift agreement, on going through files, we discovered that your file was dumped untreated so at this juncture we apologize for the delay of your payment. Please stop communicating with any office now as we have appointed a liquidator/bank overseas to handle your payment henceforth, since our apex bank, the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) has totally disappointed in this regards.

Kindly Re-confirm your Inheritance/contract payment details as evidence showing you as the true owner, to 

Barr: Chuka Amadi: info_notice16@inmail24.com

Also, send a copy to this house for record purposes.


Contact the above mentioned offices now with your Inheritance/contract payment details and to avoid complicating our network and the efforts of International Community, the United Nations and the US Government efforts in ensuring a hitch free transfer of your Overdue Inheritance funds to you, please be informed that you are not allowed to correspond to any person or office anymore since you are now dealing directly with the  Chairman Senate Committee On Foreign Payment Matters in Nigeria EMPOWERED BY THE PRESIDENT FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA.

Yours faithfully,
Ike Ekweremadu (Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs)
