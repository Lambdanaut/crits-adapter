           URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I am Mr.Alan  Collier  the fund manager of fidelity investment 
international, The world largest fund management company with over 
1.2Trillion Capital Investment Fund and over 900 thousand investors all 
over the world. Nevertheless, As the Fidelity Fund Manager, I handle all 
our Investor's Direct Capital Funds (financial funds).


As a routine, every investor gets the percentage profit or dividend 
From the total cash he or she invested into the company annually. Last 
year it was announced that the profit margin was 20% after calculating 
Carefully I found out that the profit margin was 21.1% that is an 
Excess of 1.2% on each investor so i secretly extracted 1.2% Excess 
Maximum Return Capital Profit (EMRCP) per annum on each of the 
Investor's Marginal Capital Fund and created a separate account where 
The total sum of the extraction was kept as an expert, the account has 
a value of 28, 745, 000, 00.(pounds) Now, I am looking for someone who 
I can trust to stand as an Investor to receive the fund as Annual 
Investment Proceeds from Fidelity Marginal Capital Fund. All 
Confirmable and legal documents to back up the claims will be made 
available to you as soon as possible.
 
Meanwhile, I have worked out the modalities and technicalities whereby,
The funds can be claimed in any of our 6 Clearing Houses without any
hitch. Our sharing ratio will be 50-50. If you are interested, get back to me
through email so that I will provide you with  more information 
about this transaction and also provide me with phone number to reach you 
for more details.
 
Sincerely,
Mr. Alan Collier
