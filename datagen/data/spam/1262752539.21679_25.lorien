Commissioner for the Reduction of the National Debt 
UK Debt Management Office. 
Eastcheap Court 
11 Philpot Lane 
London 
EC3M 8UD 
 
 Attention: Beneficiary,
 
 My name is Jo Whelan. 
 
As you must be aware, I am the Controller General  for the Reduction of the National Debt in the United Kingdom. I am writing you with regards to your stalled funds transfer you have been expecting  from the U.K. For your interest, I would urge you to accord this correspondence your full indulgence and attention, as you may likely have been receiving other emails of similar contents from the numerous  fraud syndicate and impostors. The authenticity and difference would be evident in a moment.
  
I was specially instructed by the Office of the Prime Minister to embark on a personal review of all long pending and stalled International Transfer Files of  all Banks Operating in the United Kingdom, including those at our Offshore Foreign Correspondent Banks, with a view of redeeming genuine cases of Transfers, and consigning others as bad debt in the Federal Budget.The office of the Prime Minister has mandated me to ensure that all genuine claim and transfers are paid. 
 
The Government of the U.K took this  major step in addressing these problems  of all stalled transfers  as a result of the global financial crisis that has affected banks by establishing an autonomous National  Debt Management Office (NDMO) to take over payment responsibility on behalf of all banks operating in the UK.  
 
The creation of the NDMO consolidates debt management functions as a result of the global financial melt-down for ensuring proper coordination of all payments emanating for the U.K. The NDMO centralizes and coordinates the country's debt recording and management activities, including debt service forecasts; transfers payments; and advising on debt negotiations as well as new borrowings. 
 
It also provides for the establishment of a supervisory board that has oversight functions on all banks operating in the UK as well as endorsement of strategic thrusts and policies for the organization, consistent with the broad policy objectives of government.   Your transfer file came to my attention just this morning, and I was compelled to take special interest in your transfer because of  its peculiar history of procedural inconsistencies and unauthorized  payment approval documents that are contained in your file.Obviously all the persons you assigned to process your transfer have proved to be fraudulent and incompetent. 
 
Simply put it that some management of the Bank have  tried unsuccessfully to smuggle your transfer  through a non-existent back door, while impersonating the offices of various government departments before you, and feeding you with forged transferred document. 
  
Consequently, I have this morning ordered the heads of all the relevant Government Departments genuinely involved in the foreign transfer protocol, including the  Treasury  Department, and the  Bank to suspend all further action on your transfer pending conclusion of my personal investigation into the actual reasons why your transfer has failed to date. Official memos have been issued to the relevant departments.
  
However, preliminary evidence shows clearly that these fraudulent persons you have assigned to help you process your transfer have been extorting monies from you through concocted excuses and lies, only for them to divert the monies colleted from you to their private pockets and return back to demand more monies from you endlessly.Please you should not allow yourself to be deceived and extorted anymore. As the Controller General for the Reduction of the National Debt in the United Kingdom, I want to assure you that your transfer will now be processed through the simple, transparent and authoritative means where you will not be required to pay any unauthorized fees.
  
Please discontinue any form of contact with all those you have been dealing with before now, no matter the nature of your relationship with any of these crooks, including your local attorney. My intention is to quickly reactivate and sort out your transfer without any distraction. So you are forbidden to preempt anyone of this contact, otherwise I will be compelled to out rightly cancel your transfer along others a bad debt.
  
Reply immediately to acknowledge this advice, and I will instruct you further.
Regards,
Jo Whelan.
Commissioner for the Reduction of the National Debt 
UK Debt Management Office.
