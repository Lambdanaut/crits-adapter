Umberland), whose noble birth washed out this blot of his captivity, and
there is a curious tradition of a conqueror setting his hound as king
over a conquered province in mockery. The king was of age at twelve. A
king of seven years of age has twelve Regents chosen in the Moot, in one
case by lot, to bring him up and rule for him till his majority. Regents
are all appointed in Denmark, in one case for lack of royal blood, one
to Scania, one to Zealand, one to Funen, two to Jutland. Underkings and
Earls are appointed by kings, and though the Earl's office is distinctly
official, succession is sometimes given to the sons of faithful fathers.
The absence of a settled succession law leads (as in Muslim States) to
rebellions and plots. Kings sometimes abdicated, giving up the crown
perforce to a rival, or in high age to a kinsman. In heathen times,
kings, as Thiodwulf tells us in the case of Domwald and Yngwere, were
sometimes sacrificed for better seasons (African fashion), and Wicar of
Norway perishes, like Iphigeneia, to procure fair winds. Kings having to
lead in war, and sometimes being willing to fight wagers of battle, are
short-lived as a rule, and assassination is a continual peril, whether
by fire at a time of feast, of which there are numerous examples,
besides the classic one on which Biarea-mal is founded and the not less
famous one of Hamlet's vengeance, or whether by steel, as with Hiartuar,
or by trick, as in Wicar's case above cited. The reward for slaying a
king is in one case 120 gold lbs.; 19 "talents" of gold from each
ringleader, 1 oz. of gold from each commoner, in the story of Godfred,
known as Ref's gild, "i.e., Fox tax". In the case of a great king,
Frode, his death is concealed for three years to avoid disturbance
within and danger from without. Captive kings were not as a rule well
treated. A Slavonic king, Daxo, offers Ragnar's son Whitesark his
daughter and half his realm, or death, and the captive strangely desires
death by fire. A captive king is exposed, chained to wild beasts, thrown
into a serpent-pit, wherein Ragnar is given the fate of the elder Gunnar
in the Eddic Lays, Atlakvida. The king is treated with great respect by
his people, he is finely clad, and his commands are carried out, however
abhorrent or absurd, as long as they do not upset customary or statute
law. The king has slaves in his household, men and women, besides his g
