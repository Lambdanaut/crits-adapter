Greetings ,

I wish to present this proposal for the purpose of investment in your
country. My name is mourien Alfred,I am 25 years old. I am the daughter of
HON.Alami Morgan Alfred the former Minister of Transport and Communication
with the present Government of President Alhaji Dr. yusuf mohamood Ali of
Sierra-Leone. My father were arrested on 1st of Nov 2003 by mohamood
Government on allegation of using their postion in the Govenment to aid
smuggling of diamond from the Kenya diamond field,it was just a political
vendetta.My father later died in the prison,it was diagnonised that he was
poisoned, but Government report says heart failure.

Whatever it is,let God be the judge. He sent a note to me before his death,
regarding a deposit of the sum of (USD$15,200.000.00) fifitheen Million Two
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars in this BANK. He instructed US to
move mmediately with the documents to a neighbouring country to seek asylum.
We moved to the Republic of Mali where we spent some time before finally
moving to Benin Republic, to enquire about the deposit.My mother is serious
sick and was admitte as hospita here Benin Republic, so i am kind of
desolete.

Meanwhile i have located the bank,and have also discussed the possible
transfer of the fund to abroad.Unfortunately,my father left a clause that
the fund should not be released to me untill i attend the age of 30,or i
have to introduce a trusted foreign partner who would be my trustee and
investor,hence the need for your assistance. I request that you be my
trustee and assist me in effecting the transfer of the fund to your account
or an account you will nominate.

You will also be resposible for the investment and management of the fund
untill i am able to join you after my education your country. You and us
will agree on a percentage you will take for your assistance. Please let me
know immediately if you can assist me so that I will give you more
informations about the deposit.

I thank you in anticipation to your quick response.

You's in God,
Miss.Mourien Alfred
