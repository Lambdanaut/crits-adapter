Dear Sir/Madam,
 
Please kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you I believe you are a highly respected personality considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events.
I am Barrister Jay Squarte, a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr.Steve Anderson, who used to work with Siamrak Company Limited. On the 21st of April 2003, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sukhumvit Express Road. 
 
Unfortunately, they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client's relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence, I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client in a Finance Company, Particularly, the Finance House where the deceased deposited the US$35 Million (Thirthy five Million United States Dollars only).
 
Consequently, this Finance House issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin to claim the US$35 Million (Thirthy five Million United States Dollars only) in their custody within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 4 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased to claim the fund as the Next of Kin to him so that the fund will be transferred to your account by the Finance House.
 
Upon receipt of the fund, I will come over to your country to meet with you for the disbursement of the fund and then you and I will share the money in this order: 50% will be for me, 40% will be for you.While 10% is for execution of the fund incase of any expenses you may encountered during the process of the fund into your account. Note that the transaction requires financial assist to enables us process the beneficiary approval order in your name legally with all the legal right and documents under my power as the personal attorney to the deceased family. all process and achievement must be legally secured. I have all the necessary legal documents that can back our claim at the Finance House.
 
All I require is your honest co-operation and financial assist to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. 
 
You are needed as a next of kin to inherit your brother left fund, be rest assured. 
If you are willing and ready to execute this mutual deal kindly feel free  and contct me through the above information with your contact details.
 
Best Regards . 
Barrister Jay Squarte (Esq).
