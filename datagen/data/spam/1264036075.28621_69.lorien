Dear Beloved,
 
My name is Mrs. Kate Brumley I am a dying woman who has decided to donate
what I have to charities through you. You may be wondering why I chose
you.But someone has to be chosen. I am 59 years old and was diagnosed
forcancer about 2 years ago, after the death of my husband who had left
me everything he worked for. I have been touched by the Lord to donate
from what I have inherited from my late husband to charity through you
for the good work of humanity, rather than allow my relatives to use
my husband's hard earned funds inappropriately.

 
I have asked the Lord to forgive me all my sins and I believe he
has,because He is merciful. I will be going in for an operation, and I pray
that I survive the operation. I have decided to Will/Donate the sum of
$10,300,000.00 (Ten Million three hundred thousand Dollars) to charities
through you for the good work of the Lord, and to help the motherless,
lessprivileged and also for the assistance of the widows.

Presently, I have informed my consultant about my decision in willing
this fund to charity through you. I wish you all the best and may the
good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always
extend the good work to others. If you are interested in carrying out
this task, I will inform my consultant, so that he can arrange the
release of the funds to you. I know I have never met you but my mind tells
me to do this, and I hope you act sincerely. I decided that 30% of this
money should be taken by you from the total sum upon the success
release of this fund, because I am now too weak and fragile to do things
myself because of my cancer.

 
NB:I sincerely know that a lot has been written about some SCAM coming
out of the world, but I assure you that this will never in any way
associated with that as you will be given the right to verify this directly
with the Bank were the funds is presently deposited.
I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the
task is accomplished, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my
last wish, due to the fact that I do not want relatives or family
members standing in the way of my last wish.
Reply me via this email address:katebrumley55@aim.com
God bless you and your family.
Mrs. Kate Brumley 
 
PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBER ON YOUR
REPLY FOR EASY AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION WITH MY CONSULTANT.
