Dear Friend,

I am a staff with GLOBAL SECURITY AND INVESTMENT LTD; My name is Mr.Eno Joseph.I was the Personal officer to Mr.Andrew Wilson, who was a renowned petroleum marketer with the Petroleum and Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PEGASSAN). Following the sad event that occurred on 27th January 2002 . My client Mr. Andrew Wilson and his immediate family who where victims of this sad event (Bomb Blast) died along with his family as there was no survivor.

Since then I have made several inquiries to his embassy to locate any of his extended Relatives, and this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, the Board of Directors are on the Verge of confiscating Late Mr. Wilson's account with GLOBAL SECURITY AND INVESTMENT LTD where he left behind huge deposits valued at about ($28.8 Million USDollars). GLOBAL SECURITY AND INVESTMENT LTD has issued me a notice to provide a next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($28.8 Million US Dollars) can be paid to you. You shall be rewarded with 30% of the total Fund.

To commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your interest and enclose your private contact telephone & fax numbers, full names & address to enable the processing of this transaction in your favor and to effect the necessary approvals. All I require is your honest co-operation and I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you and I from any breach of the law.Please I await your positive response to enable us discuss further via my private e-mail address: enojoseph@megamail.pt

Best regards,
Mr. Eno Joseph
