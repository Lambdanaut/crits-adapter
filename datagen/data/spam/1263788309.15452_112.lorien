Attention; Counselor ,

We, the management of Ashtartex, Co, Ltd.  require your legal representation
for our North American & Europe Customers.  We are of the opinion that the
ability to consolidate payments from North America & European will eradicate
delays due to inter-continental monetary transaction between Asia and North
America Europe.

We understand that a proper Attorney Client Retainer will provide the
necessary authorization and we are most inclined to commence talks as soon
as possible.  Your consideration of our request is highly anticipated and we
look forward to your prompt response / request.

Sincerely,
Moustafa Ashtar.
