Dear Beloved,
 
It is my pleasure to communicate with you on this fruitful transaction
I hope this email will meet you good heath My name is Mrs. Maria Roser I
am a dying woman who has decided to donate what I have to charities through you.
You may be wondering why I chosen you. But someone has to be chosen. 

I am 59 years old and was diagnosed for cancer about 2 years ago, after the death 
of my husband who had left me everything he worked for. I have been touched by 
the Lord to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to charity 
through you for the good work of humanity, rather than allow my relatives to use 
my husband ‘shared earned funds inappropriately. 
 
I have asked the Lord to forgive me all my sins and I believe he
has, because He is merciful. I will be going in for an operation, and I pray
that I survive the operation. I have decided to Will/Donate the sum
of $10,300,000.00 (Ten Million three hundred thousand Dollars) to charities
through you for the good work of the Lord, and to help the
motherless, lessprivileged and also for the assistance of the widows.
 
Presently, I have informed my consultant about my decision in willing
this fund to charity through you. I wish you all the best and may the good
Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend
the good work to others. If you are interested in carrying
out this task, 

I will inform my consultant, so that he can arrange the release of the funds to you
I know I have never met you but my mind tells me to do this, and I hope you act sincerely.

I decided that 30% of this money should be taken by you from the total sum upon the success release of this fund, because I am now too weak and fragile to do things myself because of my cancer.
 
Presently, I’m in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for
oesophageal cancerI have since lost my ability to talk.
 
I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the
task is accomplished, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last
wish, due to the fact that I do not want relatives or family members
standing in the way of my last wish. If you ready to carry on this task
please reply my email if you are interested.


 
God bless you and your family.
Mrs.Maria Roser
