Hello and good day !!

I am in a privilege position to make both of us benefit 15.5 Million
Pounds from a UK-based bank where I am a staff.I need a very
trustworthy,sincere and reliable foreign partner in order to achieve
success.Be assured that due process shall be followed to procure legal
documents backing up this transaction.The total sum of 15.5 million pounds
will be transfered from an account belonging to a late customer who died
with his entire immediate family,including his next-of-kin,in a plane
crash in year 2000 in the New York bound AIR FRANCE concord plane
crash.For more information and pictorial details regarding the crash
please visit : http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any other relatives up to this
moment, I am contacting you to assist and collaborate with me in
repatriating all the money left behind by late property magnate.I have
reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally possible to use
my position to manipulate to make you the next-of-kin.This is achievable
if you allow me to present you (as the next-of-kin to the deceased) to the
management of the branch of bank so that the proceeds of the account can
be processed in your name and subsequently be paid to you.But all I
require from you is your honest co-operation to enable us see this
business through.Trust me, as the account officer to the deceased I hereby
assure you that all modalities have been properly worked out and I propose
we share the proceeds in the ratio of 60% to me and 40% to you.

All I require from you to commence the immediate process are just the
following : (1) Full names (2) Contact address (3) Phone & fax numbers (4)
your profile.

Awaiting your response to enable me give you more details & procedures to
be adopted.

Very Sincerely
Terry Grant
