Attn:From Mr.Ngomi,
 
I am Mr.Tony Ngomi, Manager of a Bank in South Africa.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 
On June 6, 2001, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the National Crude Oil Corporation of my country, Mr. Haffez Al Sadique made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Crude Oil Export Corporation that Mr.Haffez Al Sadique died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
 
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Haffez Al Sadique did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  
 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Haffez Al Sadique so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
 
Please send me an mail with further information about yourself before we proceed further. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.

Thanks and regards. 
 
Mr.Tony Ngomi.
