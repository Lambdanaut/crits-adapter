<DIV>
<B>I am the chairman of Seven (7) Man Presidential Panel, Debt Committee On Contract Executed </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>in Power Sector. This panel was set up and empowered by three factors: The President Of </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Nigeria, Mallam Musa Yar'Adua, Members of G-34 and the Honorable Members of the Judicial </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Panel, to review and subsequently recommendation given on all duly executed contracts </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>awarded to "Foreign &amp; Local Contractors" during the last Govt. of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>we discovered an over-invoiced contract sum to the tune of One Hundred Million United States </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Dollars USD$100,000,000.00). We further traced the origin of this sum and thus, found out </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>that it was deliberately over-invoiced by the then "Contract Awarding Committee" before they </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>were dissolved. As it stands now, we are very confident that the Government has no knowledge of this sum; neither does the dissolved committee have access to the said sum again. We still have almost one year to conclude duty and it is only then that we shall give official reports and probably refer this over-invoiced contract sum back to the Federal Government's purse.It is in the light of this that my colleagues and myself decided to confidently contact you urgently so that we could perfectly present you or your company as! one of the "Foreign Contractors" that executed a contract for the Nigerian Government, and we shall recommend only $15 Million United States Dollars (USD$15,000,000.00) to be processed and transfered into your account. Thereafter, we shall refer back to the Government's purse the balance of EIGTHY FIVE Million Dollars (USD$85,000,000.00). We have carefully worked out the strategies to secure all the necessary DOCUMENTS in your name and there is no room for fai

<DIV>
<B>If we have understood ourselves and believed with trust that we could do this DEAL together </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>and move this sum of Fifteen Million Dollars (USD$15,000,000.00) TO YOU, </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>then forward to me urgently the following; </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>1. Your full names</B></DIV>

<B>2. Your confidential address</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>3. Your direct Telephone and fax numbers.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>We shall further discuss and agree on the percentage sharing as soon as we hear from you </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>affirmatively. </B></DIV>

<B>Note: that we have closed every track that might lead to any trace of this fund. </B></DIV>
