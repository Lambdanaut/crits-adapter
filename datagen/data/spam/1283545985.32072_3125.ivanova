Monitoring Unit we have also

been transacting with
some impostors and fraudsters who have 
been impersonating the
likes of Mr. Sanusi of Central Bank of 
Nigeria, Mr. Tunde Sulaiman
of Chevron, Mr. John J. McCloy of World 
Bank, Mr. Ban Ki-moon of
United Nations, President Goodluck 
Jonathan of Federal republic of Nigeria,

<p>The Cyber Crime Division of the FBI in

Complaint Center (IFCC) of how some 
people have lost outrageous
sums of money to these impostors. As a 
result of this we hereby

one not referred to you
by us as we have investigated  these 
bodies and have found out that they were 
impostors and have hence directed 
beneficiaries to rightful claim 
centers</p>

Ministry of Finance and
World bank that your payment totaling 
$1,200,000.00USD be
released to you via a Customized Pin ATM 
Card.

are to receive your
payment because it’s more guaranteed as 
an online account will be set up in your 
name and your funds worth 
$1,200,000.00USD be remitted into the 
account for your in-house onward transfer 
to your nominated account, since over $5 
Billion USD
was lost on fake check year 2008 and 
hence we have cancelled payments through 
checks.</p>

payment, because we have
perfected everything in regards to the 
release of your
$1,200,000.00USD to be 100% risk free and

as a result of the
mandate from US Government to make sure 
all debts owed to people
which includes Inheritance, Contract, 
Lottery, Compensation etc
are been cleared for the betterment of 
the current economic
status of the nation and its citizens as 
he has always believed
“Our Time for Change has come” because 
“Change can happen</p>
