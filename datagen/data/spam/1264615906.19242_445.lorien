Greetings!

Do accept my apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics. I want to introduce myself and this business 

opportunity to you. My names are Mark Richard Measday, an accountant with Abbey National Bank Plc, here in UK.

I wish to know if we can work together. I would like you to stand as the next of kin to my deceased client who made 

some deposits to my bank worth £10.7million GBP. (Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling) He 

died without any registered next of kin and as such the funds now have an open beneficiary mandate. Fortunately, 

both of you have the same last name so it will be very easy to make you become his official next of kin.
If you are interested you do let me know so that I can give you comprehensive details on what we are to do, 
Tony: I urgently hope to get your response as soon as possible.

Best Regards,
Mr. Mark Richard Measday
