Dear Sir/Madam, 
  
I am Dr. Charles Morgan (FNB Director of International Remittance) a division of First Rand Bank limited South Africa I am making this contact with you based on the need for an individual/company who is willing to assist me with a solution to a money transfer. 
 
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to count on you, as a respected and honest person to handle this transaction with sincerity, trust and confidentiality. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. 
  
There is an account opened in this bank in 1997 and till 2003 nobody has operated on this account again after going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. This deposit was for 5 years and upon maturity I made effort to contact my client, l could not reach him. I was forced to travel to Germany and there I got the tragic news that, my client Mr. G. Klohn, his wife Diane, Ann Killian, their daughter, his son in law Christian, and their children Mary, Walter Killian , all perished on the Monday, 31 July, 2000 plane crash in western German city of Moenchengladbach. No other person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account and the money involved is USD$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million United Dollars Only). 
  
View the web site bellow for more information on our late client. 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm 
  
I want us to first transfer USD$10 Million from this money into your safe overseas account before the rest and this is to avoid any breach of law to both Countries. I am seeking your assistance as a foreigner, since as civil servant I am not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Should you be willing to assist in this transaction your share as compensation will be USD$10, 000,000.00 (40%), while I will receive USD$15, 000.000.00 (60%). 
  
The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. And this is 100% risk free. Kindly notify me by sending your secured mobile phone and fax numbers for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal. 
  
Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation. 
Sincerely, 
 
Dr. Charles Morgan
