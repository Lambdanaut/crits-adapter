Dear Sir/Madam,  

Good day and compliments, I know this letter will definitely come to you as a huge surprise, but I implore you to take the time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will go a long way to determine my future and continued existence. Please allow me to introduce myself.I am Sgt.Mark George, a member of the US 3rd Infantry Division 選ron達rigade Combat Team,remaining at Mahmudiyah in Iraq.I am desperately in need of an assistance hence i summoned up courage to contact you.

Also, I do hereby wish to crave your indulgence for your time to visit the BBC website as stated below to enable you have the brief insight as to what I知 intending to share with you, believing that it might interest you one way or the other. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2988455.stm

Meanwhile,I am presently in Iraq and I found your contact particulars in an internet address journal.I am seeking your assistance to receive the sum of $50 Million(Fifty Million USD) as far as I can be assured that it will be safe in your care until I complete my service here. This is no stolen money and there are no dangers involved. 

I have successfully moved the fund through a diplomat to a better secured place in Atlanta Georgia(U.S.A).I do not know for how long I will remain here as I have been lucky to have survived two suicide bomb attacks by Pure Divine intervention. This and other reasons put into consideration have prompted me to reach out for help.

Get back to me after visiting the e-mail to enable us discuss in details and also do not misconstrue my intention. I知 just being very strict and careful.


Respectfully, 

Sgt. Mark George
