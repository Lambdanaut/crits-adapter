TOP SECRET  
  
This letter would definitely come to you as a surprise owing to the fact that you and I have never had any prior communication. Kindly go through this message and do endeavor to attend to it with all seriousness. 
  
I am Ron Roeder, a Swiss Citizen and a former banker who was laid off after a Forex trading scandal that involved my department when I was with the UBS AG in Zurich . You shall get to know more about this once you have declared your interest in this life changing deal I am introducing herein. I write to know if you will be interested in working with me on a deal that can make us instant millionaires if we can be sincere, tactical and disciplined. This is a deal that can run for several months without being unveiled if only we can keep our secrets between just the two of us, and without showing off our wealth to attract undue attentions.    
  
My former position at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS AG) did expose me to so many kinds of accounts vis-à-vis coded accounts belonging to money launderers, dormant accounts belonging to late/deceased customers, looted deposits belonging to corrupt leaders (in some cases the leaders are dead, like the case of Saddam Hussein). The Swiss banking system is like a cult and so much looted money belonging to corrupt public servants across the globe are often sat on without being traced when such individual dies or being probed by his government.    
  
I am a seasoned expert in Information Technology (IT). With my experience and job exposure, I have the keys to unlock some of the aforementioned accounts types and pull out funds without being noticed. I am capable of juggling through the bank’s database and make transfers by both Swift, RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) and plastic means (Debit and ATM Cards) without being noticed by any known banking security device. As a matter of fact I have personally developed/built an OFX (Open Financial Exchange) platform which is Powered by TUBO SWIFT. This is an i2cbank Electronic Transaction Processing and Personal Financial Management (PFM) equipments/applications. It’s Network is built around a secure e-commerce transaction SSL Certificates that enables up to 256-bit encryption including Signing Technologies, Identity Verification Developer Solutions and Anti-Phishing Tools which enhances smooth and undetectable telex. The tools are provided by bankserv (www.bankserv.com), who a!

This is a risk free deal which can never be traced to anybody because it is strictly online and simply done using the proper codes, encryptions, holograms and embossments. All I need is someone that can bring an account outside of Switzerland . That explains why I am contacting you with the hope that you will show interest. I will send the funds from here while you pull it out from your own end, and we can share it 50/50. This is a deal that guarantees average weekly returns of at least $200,000. For instance, one of the dormant deposits contains US$500,000,000.00 and we would be retrieving the funds in an installment of smaller amounts (say $25,000 every day, depending on your ability to handle the inflows from your country). I suggest we start low and later set up more bank accounts to be able to increase the transaction volume/amount. It is a SameDayPay swift, meaning that funds gets to your account the same day it is wired out from my end. 
  
Kindly indicate your position through a return mail so that I can update you further. In this year 2010, I need a lot of money and that is why I want to start-off this deal very quickly so as to be able to retrieve enough funds before the middle of the year.. Please if you are skeptical about anything just feel free to ask for further clarifications on my winning strategies, and why I am so sure of being successful in the deal. If I had an offshore account outside of Switzerland I would have done this deal all alone without having to involve anyone. Please let us strike this deal together for our mutual gains. I am anxiously waiting for your response whether you are interested or not. I do not want to contact anyone else on this subject matter to avoid spreading this news. That is why your immediate response is so important to me, as that would enable me to know if I should contact another person in the event you are not interested. More details (with documentary evidence) s!
 hall be disclosed upon your accept
