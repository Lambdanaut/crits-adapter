At this must be much more harsh and severe to you, on whom it falls; but
{yet} I take it no less amiss {than you}. How it is so I know not, nor
can I account for it, except that from my heart I wish you well. CLIT.
Did not you say that my father was waiting here? _Enter CHREMES from his
house._ MEN. See, here he is. (_MENEDEMUS goes into his house._) CHREM.
Why are you blaming me, Clitipho? Whatever I have done in this matter, I
had a view to you and your imprudence. When I saw that you were of a
careless disposition, and held the pleasures of the moment of the first
importance, and did not look forward to the future, I took measures that
you might neither want nor be able to waste this {which I have}. When,
through your own {conduct}, it was not allowed me to give it you, to
whom I ought before all, I had recourse to those who were your nearest
relations; to them I have made over and intrusted every thing.[98] There
you'll always find a refuge for your folly; food, clothing, and a roof
under which to betake yourself. CLIT. Ah me! CHREM. It is better than
that, you being my heir, Bacchis should possess this {estate of mine}.
SYR. (_apart._) I'm ruined irrevocably! --Of what mischief have I,
wretch that I am, unthinkingly been the cause? CLIT. Would I were dead!
CHREM. Prithee, first learn what it is to live
