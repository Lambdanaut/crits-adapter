Dear Friend,
 
I wish to seek your assistance for the transfer of US$140 Million depository made by a foreign investor for an investment programmed that has remained dormant for years now.  I discovered that the account holder died without making a WILL on the depository. This money cannot be approved to a local bank account holder, but can only be approved to a foreigner. If you will stand as next of kin to the fund, it will be shared 60%/40%, as this is a TWO-man business transaction.
 
I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I need your assistance and co-operation to this reality as I have done my Home-work and fine tune the best way to front you as the beneficiary of the fund. My position as the branch manager of the bank will be used to advance this deal.
 
I will like you to provide immediately your full Names and Address, Date of Birth, Occupation, Tel & Fax Numbers so that an Attorney will be able to prepare the necessary documents and affidavit which will put you in place as the next of kin.  The Attorney will draft and carry out the notarization of  the WILL and also obtain the necessary documents and letter of  probate/administration in your favor for the claim.
 
I will appreciate your early reply for commencement of business, and whereby you are not interested; please indicate in your reply so that I can seek for the assistance of someone else. If this proposal is acceptable by you, I expect that you will not take undue advantage of the trust I will bestow in you. I await your urgent response. All enquiries should be directed to this email address: akintolawilliams_ub@jqmail.jp
 
Thanks with great regards.

Mr.Akintola Williams
