Compliments Of The Day, 

Permit me to introduce myself to you. My name is Samuel Cousins, a Non- Executive Director of  the above Finance Corporation in London,United Kingdom. I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable person/company to handle an important assingment on behalf of myself.

PROPOSITION: An Australian Engr Andrea Osbourne, a prosperous oil\Gold merchant had in our Bank the sum of £45,758,000 (Forty Five, Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Eight Thousand British Pounds Sterling) in a domiciliary account. Unfortunately, he was killed in a recent ghastly motor accident in London. Efforts had been made by the management of my bank through the Australian Embassy to contact any of the deceased children but to
no avail. We later discovered that he had no children. Given the skeletal information available to the bank, it has so far been impossible to reach any of the relatives. The situation left for the Management is to declare the deceased account dormant and revert the funds to trading for interest to the Bank. In order to avoid this development, I now seek your approval to have you stand as a distant relative to Engr Andrea Osbourne,so that the money would be released and transfer to you.

All documents and proofs to enable you get the money will be carefully packaged once we receive your consent on this proposal. I shall apply for a leave as
soon as the funds get into your reliable account to come to your country for sharing and investments which you will assist me in doing.
May I assure you that this is safe and risk-free, as I have taken care of all necessary modalities to ensure a hitch-free movement.Thank You for taking the time in reviewing this request, as I will stand by the strength of your response, and look forward to speaking with you soon. I may be reached directly at +44-701-113-9035.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.

Best Regards,
Samuel Cousins
Non- Executive Director
