 Only a chosen few Beside the crew Were gathered on the pier; And in the
ebb and flow Of dark and moon, we saw them fare Straight past the row of
coffins Where the fifth crew lay Waiting their last short voyage Across
the bay. And, as they went, not one among them swerved, But eyes went
homing swiftly to the West, Where, faint and very few, The windows of
the town called out to them Yet held them nerved And ready for the test.
Young every one, they brought life at its best. In the taut stillness,
not a word Was uttered
