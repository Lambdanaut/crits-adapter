Dear Beneficiary:
 
I am sorry for the cheque I sent to you for your payment, which you’re unable to Cash
due to some unforeseen circumstances. I was able to cash the money here and paid all 
the necessary bills involved in the transactions, and your INTEREST of $1,000 000.00 
(One Million United States Dollars) is in cash, and I boxed the money and deposited 
it with UPS DIPLOMATIC COURIER COMPANY to deliver it to you as a cash payment, this 
is the only best system and fastest means to pay you, at this time. You are to contact
 the UPS COURIER COMPANY with your delivery details including your telephone number, 
so that they will deliver the package (boxed money) to your personal address, within 
48 hours. The UPS Representative or Officer in charge of the box details is below:-

Please I want to let you know that only the supervisor knows the content and nobody
 else knows about this. You are to contact only Mr. Benet Davis the supervisor,
 so please waist no time in contacting them. I have paid for the delivery fee so the 
only money you have to send to them now is the security  keeping fee of your consignment 
and it is $150 United States Dollars.

I would have paid that but they said no because they don't know when you will contact 
them and in case of demurrage. Please I will advice you to be friendly with Mr Benet Davis the supervisor because he alone has the idea of the content of your consignment.
 But i want to let you know that I did not give him  the key of the boxes so please take 
note that as soon as they deliver the consignment use this (CODE NUMBERS TO OPEN THE TWO 
BOXES TO KNOW IF THE  COMPLETE ONE MILLION USD IS IN IT).
 

THE FIRST BOX CODE  (0036589) THE SECOND BOX CODE  (0014759)  AND I WANT YOU TO KEEP THIS
CODE NUMBERS CONFIDENTIAL IN YOUR HOME TO AVOID ANOTHER PERSON GETTING IN TOUCH WITH YOUR
MONEY MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.NOTE THAT THE ONLY MONEY YOU WILL PAY UPS IS $150 
DOLLARS AND NO MORE.

Thanks for your patience
Sincerely
Mrs. Sharon Jones
