Itless powers of physical enjoyment, whose senses are exquisitely fitted
for pleasure, is not satisfied with pleasure, but, in obedience to
unseen attractions, ever seeks for higher things. Whence does this
eagerness come? Is it from man himself? Then our problem is great
indeed, for, at one and the same time, something within himself impels
him upward, and another something drags him downward. But the point for
special consideration now is that the soul is never satisfied with
anything but truth, that the history of thought is the record of the
search for truth, that every new discovery has acted as a stimulus to
still more ardent exploration, and that the search is always for
elemental realities, the causes of phenomena, for "things as they are."
The promise of Jesus was fulfilled long before it was spoken. Some one,
in all the ages, has been leading into truth and showing things to come;
and the process was never more evident than after all these years of
intellectual and spiritual progress. I say some one has led. By that I
mean a personal spirit, unseen, but ever present; for how could he whose
home is in the mire be supposed, steadily and unwaveringly, to reach
toward the skies unless there was some attraction in the skies? The only
attraction for one spirit is another spirit. This age-long, unwavering
passion for truth and progress, the wisest of men have believed to have
been inspired by Providence or God or by guardian angels--which after
all are only other ways of stating the doctrine of Jesus concerning the
Holy Spirit. Another phase of this subject is the power, which has
seemed to come from outside the soul, to sustain and help those who have
been called to endure bitter and long-continued sorrow and pain. Those
who feel themselves to be weak as water under the stress of severe
trial, almost without previous suggestion, assume the proportions of
heroes. They endure and suffer with patience what would crush those who
are only physically brave and strong. A woman who seemed to have few
resources in herself, suddenly lost four children. In speaking of it,
she very simply but forcefully, said: "I could never have endured it
myself." She believed that her fragility had been reinforced by one
stronger than herself. Exceptional physical courage
