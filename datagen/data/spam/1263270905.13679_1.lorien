Attn:Beneficiary,

       
 
RE: RELEASE OF YOUR OVERDUE PAYMENT

Following the recent meeting held with new, Chairman of ECONOMIC ON FINANCIAL CRIME COMMISSION (EFCC), As stated above by the president of the federal republic of Nigeria during the visit of the United Nations' secretary on his speech to the nation, couple with recommendation and resolution of last visit of the president to south Africa, British, France and the United State of America (United Nations General Assembly in New York), a total sum of $1.6 Billion has been mapped out by the SENATE 
to settle all outstanding debts owned to contractors, it has therefore become imperative for us to explore our options for reducing our debt servicing payment to affordable and sustainable levels. On the order of the president as a mark of his reconciliation and image laundering exercise toward sanitizing the battered image of the Federal Republic of Nigeria abroad.


I am Terry Dagogo ( Deputy Chairman Investigation on Economic & Financial Crime Commission). The purpose of the committee among other is to investigate, verify and settle all outstanding debts owed to foreign contractors/beneficiaries whose payment is overdue During the last military dictatorship of late General Sani Abacha and president Olusegun Obasanjo. Many abnormalities had happened in the central bank of Nigeria where some top official of the apex Bank collected money from innocent 
contractors and abandon them half way with levies and taxes before and during the appointment of Professor Charles Soludo.

Consequently, we received a directive from the office of the President and also the new Central bank Governor(Lamodi Sanusi Lamodi)ordering the above office to settle all genuine contractors/beneficiaries whose debts has been outstanding for a long time now, and also for the beneficiary to be come down to Nigeria and witness the Transfer exercise.


Note that The reasons why your payment is been delayed for so long is that there was a counter claim for the payment of your funds by Edward Dombrowski and the former payment authorization code that was issued to you has been used to pay other contractors/beneficiaries, therefore anytime the formar payment authorization code is place on the payment system for transfer it will indicate paid or used. This office will want to know if you sign any “Deed of Assignment” in favor of Edward 
Dombrowski , thereby making him the current beneficiary with the following account details submitted by Edward Dombrowski:
Bank Name: National City Bank,
Account Name: Edward Dombrowski,
Bank address:9109 South Highway 1
Port Saint Lucie, FL 34952
Account Number: 132734401,
Routing Number: 267084199
Swift Code: NATCUS33
ABA#: 083000056
Branch ID 00231
 
If you are aware of this, kindly explain on this issue, so that we can instruct the paying bank to release the fund to the above stated bank account submitted by Mr. Edward Dombrowski in receiving the payment on your behalf, to avoid making payment to a wrong person. In view of this, the federal government of Nigeria has empowered this Office to dismiss and prosecute any paying bank officials, under section 35A sub section 1-2-4 of the criminal code of Nigeria while trying to go against rule 
and regulations of this committee will be dealt with. Also, for some of the top banks officials who in the past collected money from contractors without them releasing their legitimate contract fund;inheritance have been declared wanted by the committee. This Office is glad to inform you that your payment shall be made as soon as this information needed from you is submitted to this committee then your payment could be made through telegraphic transfer or by international certified Bank draft.

 
Forward your Banking particulars, your address,your direct phone and fax numbers to this office immediately for immediate reconfirmation and release of your us$15. 5 million.
You are advice not to accept any fax or telephone calls that does not come from this office. Call the Deputy chairman of the committee immediately you receive this message for more information on his direct line:+234-803-388-2858 and all your reply should be directed to E-MAIL: dagogoefcc3@gmail.com
