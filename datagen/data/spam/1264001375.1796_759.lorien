Kaneshie Branch
Accra, Ghana.
 
Esteemed Compliments,
 
I anticipate that you read this mail quickly and let me know your opinion or willingness on this classified information that I will release to you.
 
Firstly, I am a happily married man with 3 kids and therefore I would not want to jeopardize this opportunity to change my financial status that will give my family a secured future.
 
I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us,as the Branch Manager of the Eco Bank Of Ghana, It is my duty to send in a financial report to my Head Office in the capital city Accra-Ghana at the end of each year. On the course of the last two years report (2008), I discovered that my Branch in which I am the
Manager made a proceed of $8,750,000.00 (Eight Million seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) which my Head Office are not aware of nor must they know that I am involved in this transaction.
 
I have since place this fund on what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without any beneficiary. As an Officer of the bank I am not directly connected to the fund, this is why I am contacting you for us to work so that you can assist in receiving this money into your Bank Account for us to SHARE, while you will have 35% of the total fund. Note there are practically no risk involved, it will be bank to bank transfer, all I need from you is to stand as the Original Depositor of this fund who made the deposit with our branch so that my Head Office can order the transfer to your designated Bank Account. If you accept this offer to work with me, I will appreciate it very much. As soon as I receive your kind response, I will give you details on how we can achieve it successfully.
