FROM THE DESK OF FAIZ IMAM  

I am Faiz Imam, a top executive in a reputable oil and gas company based in the United Kingdom. (I will provide you details subsequently). Permit me to ask for your utmost confidentiality in the matter I write to you about. I have been a top executive of this company for several years during which time the company executed a lot of contracts in the Energy and Gas sector successfully. I will spare you details of our mode of operation and go straight to the issue at hand. 

We did issue a contract  to a major company which was executed successfully and the contract sum paid in full, except for the fact that we over-invoiced the contract sum to the tune of Eight million two hundred and fifty  thousand British Pounds (GPB 8,250,000). This money was paid alongside the main contract sum and we have it kept safely in an escrow account. This is one of the deals being done regularly in Oil rich nations by Oil & Gas workers and a few lucky individuals involved. There are a few of us from the various departments involved in this deal and we have decided to do this in order to secure the future of our families.

We need a neutral partner who will stand as a subcontractor and will be paid this fund without arousing unnecessary suspicion. From our investigation, you are an honest person who will feel can help us stand as the beneficiary of this fund.   

We have taken the necessary precautions to ensure that this transaction is 100% legal and safe, as due documentations are provided. For your assistance, we shall offer you 20% of the total fund, and we have set aside 5% for any expenses. Soon as the fund is transferred to over to you we shall come over to your country for our share of the money.   

Should you be interested please contact me ONLY via my private email as I do intend to keep this transaction as discrete as possible and would advice you do same.   

Regards  

Dr. Faiz  Imam.
