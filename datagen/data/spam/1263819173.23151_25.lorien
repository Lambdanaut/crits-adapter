First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to read our job offer. My name is William (Bill) R. Walker supervisor at Virginia Employment Commission (VEC). We have recently initiated a project in collaboration with all private sector companies and set up an employment plan and new business strategies. In the progress of creating a new Multi Level e-commerce strategy, I am looking forward to establish a business relationship with you. With your efforts and our knowledge, this opportunity can become everything from a means of earning a little extra cash to building an international business. As a business, it offers the greatest flexibility and personal freedom of time. A few hours a week can earn a significant supplemental income and may grow to a very large income, making other work unnecessary. If you show interest in our offer please contact us at VEC@consultant.com for more information.

Looking forward in doing business together!

William (Bill) R. Walker, supervisor
Virginia Employment Commission (VEC)
