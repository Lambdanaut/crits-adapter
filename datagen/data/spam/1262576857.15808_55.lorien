Greetings,

As you read this, I don´t want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Mr. javed mian, from USA; I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have since lost my power of speech and can only manage to write now; as that has been the only way I am able to communicate.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never  generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that is  the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in UK, Brazil and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria; they refused and kept the money to themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contented with what I have left for them. The last of my money which only few of them knows of is the huge cash deposit that I have with my Bank in London.

I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.

Best Regards,

Mr. Javed Mian
