Dear Friend,

With due respect to your person,I Paul Graham kindly wish to ask for your
attention and consideration just for a while. I know this is certainly not
the appropriate channel to contact you but situation necessitated me to do
this. However,I am sincerely sorry for any inconveniences this may cause
you. I am a senior staff of a bank here in LONDON, and I have a business
proposal which will benefit you and i if it is properly executed.

I was the account officer and personal friend to Colin Morley who died in
the July 2005 London bomb blast. Colin Morley was a reputable customer of
my bank before he died in the 2005 London bomb blast.

 He however had a deposit of Nine million two hundred thousand British
Pounds(9.2Million GBP) with the bank and his family members are not aware
of this particular account due to the perennial crisis in his marital
home.

As his confidant and an account officer, he warned me on the implication
of disclosing his account status to
any member of his family.

 For more details and confirmation please try and visit this site below
for clarification:

Based on this, I want you join me in my plans to get this money.

All I need do is to present you as the next of kin to the deceased,the
bank would transfer the funds to you as the beneficiary .Please note the
urgency in this transaction and a timely response is required so that we
can meet with the bank's deadline.

Please have no fear for I assure you that all relevant documents needed to
make this deal successful shall be forwarded to you as soon as I receive a
positive response from you. Note that we need joint effort to make this
deal successful.

I believe strongly that if this deal is carefully executed, it would be of
great benefit to both us.

Waiting earnestly for your response.reply me on my private mail on
p.graham11111@yahoo.de



Best regard,

Paul Graham
