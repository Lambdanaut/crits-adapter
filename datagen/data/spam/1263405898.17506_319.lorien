SOURCE OF FUNDS:
The documents of the above funds in question was handed over to me to be used in payment of an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with my boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have been deposited with a bank outside Russia, where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was on the process, My Boss was arrested for his involvement on politics in financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat to FORMER President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian President. You can catch more of the story on this: http://www.mosnews.com/mn-files/khodorkovsky.shtml,http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html

YOUR ROLE:
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Bank transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to relocate to U.A.E continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates so as to free my self from the hands of the present government. The transaction has to be concluded in 7 days upon the receipt of your response to me. As soon as I get your willingness to comply I will give you moredetails and also tell you what I shall require from you. Finally I will let you know my location in Europe and where this fund is at present for security reasons.
