Hello Dear,

I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a large sum of money from a dormant account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day

PROPOSITION 
I discovered an abandoned sum of US$7,500, 000.00 (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign Customers (an American) late George Brumley. This very account has been dormant for some years now. After my investigations, I discovered that the account owner has died since July 2003 with all his family members in a plane crash, Please click this link: 
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html

Since his death, nobody has come forward to lay claims to this money and recently my bank issued a notice that the account will be declared unserviceable and the funds called to the government treasury since no relative of the deceased customer came up.

In order to avert this negative action, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin so that funds can be released in your favour as the next of kin.

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following if you are willing to work with me actually.

1. Your full name
2. Postal address
3. Profession 
4. Telephone and fax numbers

This information will enable me work on the Deceased account file so as to indicate you as his next of kin after which you will formally apply for the release of the funds as the next of kin to the Deceased customer to this bank I work at. We are going to share the total sum on final conclusion of this project on a 50-50 equal.

If you are truly disposed and capable of handling this, reach me immediately. 

Regards,
Dr. G. Patrick.
