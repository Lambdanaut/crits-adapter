My Dear Friend,

Compliments of the season!
After six months in the hospital bed I came out healthy. unfortunately, my  mailbox has been closed due to the fact that it has not been serviced for six good months, so I decided to send this to your old email address that you gave to me last year. Finally,  a solution have arrived. I have a bank here that want to give me urgent loan of 150,000.00EURO but I need to get their application fee of 185.00EURO. This is urgent, I want you to send the 185EURO immediately to the Loan officer in the information as below:

Receiver : ALFRED BIMINBI
City  : COTONOU
Country : BENIN REPUBLIC
QEST.CABB
ANS.  APPI
Amount : 185 EURO
BY WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER

Friend, this is urgent to enable us have the loan to settle all the issue with the Swiss Bank and have my funds transferred to your account. I have already concluded discussion with the International Remittance Director of the Swiss Bank who assured me that as soon as we pay the transfer cost of 1% he will wire the funds into your bank account, he also asked me about you because he said for this six months that I have been hospitalized that has not heard from you. Please update me if you have any information new to change under this Transaction Like your phone numbers, address and any other information that you may consider relevant.

Yours
Ms. Jessica Kone
