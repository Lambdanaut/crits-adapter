Hello Dear,

My warm greetings to you. Do take this email as real and contribution to 
humanity development. This is not an easy task due to my health condition and 
that is the main reason why I contacted you after viewing your profile from the international 
directory. Not actually that you are the best with my intellectual grading but I was 
driven to contact you from the innermost being. And that was my main reason 
for getting to you. Please do not be offended and I will understand completely if you 
cannot be of assistance to me.

My name is Mrs.Margriet Bernhard; I am a dying woman who has decided to 
donate what I have to you for humanity services. I am 58 years old 
(Netherlands Citizen) and I was diagnosed for cancer for about 1 years ago immediately 
after the death of my husband who has left me everything he worked for and because the doctors 
told me I will not live longer than some weeks because of my health. 

I decided to WILL/donate the sum of $5,500 000 (Five million, five hundred 
thousand dollars) to you for the good work of humanity and also to help the 
motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the widows.I wish you all the best 
and may the good Lord bless you abundantly and please use the funds well and always extend the good 
work to others.

Here is the Contact information of my Attorney below:

Asesoria Cortijo
Notario & Tribunal
Mr.Martinez Pedro
Phone:+34-687-665-538
Email:deabogado@aim.com

and tell him that I have WILLED $5,500 000 (Five million, five hundred 
thousand dollars) to you and I have also notified him. I know I don't know you but I 
have been directed to do this. 

NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the
task is accomplished as i don't want anything that will jeopardize my
wishes.
From Mrs.Margriet Bernhard
