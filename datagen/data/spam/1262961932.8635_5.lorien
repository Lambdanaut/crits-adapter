Hello Dear,
I know that this message will come to you as a surprise; I am the regional
manager of Alliance  Bank Malaysia, Branch manager here in Kuala Lumpur.
I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident that I am
about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.
I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of Ten Million Six
Hundred thousand US Dollars (USD$10.6000, 00) to your Account within 14
banking days, this money has been dormant for years in our Bank without
claim.
I want our Bank to release the money to you as the nearest person to our
deceased customer, the owner of the account died along with his supposed
next of kin since 2006 in Iraq war.
I don't want the money to go into our Bank treasury as an abandoned fund, so
this is the reason why I contacted you so that our bank head Office can
approve and release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased
customer hence you have the surname with him.
Please I would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret and delete it
if you are not interested. Upon receipt of your reply, I will give you full
details on how the business will be executed and also note that you will
have 35% of the above mentioned sum if you agree to handle this business
with me.
I look forward to your quick reply.
Best Regards.
Dr.Omar A.Razak
