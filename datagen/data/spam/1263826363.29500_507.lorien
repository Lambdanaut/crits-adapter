Dear Friend,

I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life.

I believe you are a respected personality considering the fact that i sourced your profile from a human resource profile database of your country.

However strange or surprising this contact might seems to you as we have not met before either physically or through correspondence, Though this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused,but i ask that you take due consideration of my mail as i think is quite safe and preferable for me dealing with foreigner outside my country. However, this correspondence is purely private, and it should be treated as such.

I am serious minded person. I am the above named person from Thailand. I am married to late MR.STEVEN HARRIS a Canadian who worked with ESSO Thailand Co. Ltd here in Thailand before his death last 4 years ago as a result of his heart problem. My husband died of a sudden heart attack on the 22nd of August 2006 and before his death, we were true born again christians and married for good period of fourteen year.

My only daughter who is my all died in a ghastly car accident with her two school mates early November 2007 along on-nut express road here in Bangkok during while returning back home from school vacation.

Since the death of my husband and daughter,I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$ 5,000,000.00 (Five Million U.S. Dollars) with a financial house. Presently, this money is still in the Bank.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next six months due to a serious cancer problem that i have been suffering from for the past years back, Having known my condition I decided to look for an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and i don't want my husband efforts to go into the hands of my wicked relatives the persecutors who are waiting for my death.

I don't want them to eat my husband's labour,This is why I am taking this decision to release the fund to a foreigner who is willing to act accordingly as i stated herein. I am not afraid of death anymore, hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord, Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my relatives around me always, I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply with fully assurance that you will act accordingly as i stated herein, I shall instruct my family lawyer to prepare an Authorization letter of claiming the fund in your name as the beneficiary then inform the financial house that you are the beneficiary of the said fund so that they can contact you for the releasing of the fund to you.  My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian, Whosoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth.

Yours faithfully,
Mrs Duan Harris

(2). contact address:
(3). Telephone number:
