Please advise if you were still looking for lists of US doctors or dentists.
I have many different US medical lists, let me know what you need and I will get you some details, samples and discounted prices.

Please email me here instead: Marcia@choicemedicaldata.net (make sure to include a copy of this email in your reply)

Otherwise if you needed to have your email unlisted from our campaigns please send a request here: rembox@choicemedicaldata.net
