Hello Dear=20


This letter must come to you as a surprise, but I believe it is only a d=
ay that people meet that they can become great friends and business part=
ners. I am Mr. David Pencil currently Branch Manager with a reputable ba=
nk here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing tha=
t I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I ha=
ve an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On Marc=
h 1ST, 2006, a property consultant and importer of used cars, Mr. Zaache=
ry R.  Kostrica  made  a  (Fixed) Deposit for twenty four calendar month=
s, valued at 3.5m(GBP) (Three Million Five  Hundred Thousand British pou=
nds sterling) in my branch and I happen to be his account officer before=
 I was moved to my present position recently. It was to my utter surpris=
e that Mr. Zaachary was among the death victims in May 26 2006 Earthquak=
e disaster in Jawa, Indonesia that killed over 5,000 people. He was in I=
ndonesia on a business trip and that was how he met his end.


Upon the maturity in 2008, as his account officer, it is my duty to noti=
fy him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forw=
arding address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, =
I tried sending back the  letter, but it was again returned and finally =
I discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. Zaachery was as a vic=
tim of  above mentioned May 26, 2006 Earthquake disaster in Jawa, Indone=
sia and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin  or relati=
on in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork i=
n my Bank and did not leave any WILL.  This =20
sum of 3,500,000.00(GBP) have been floating and placed under dormant/uns=
erviceable account by my bank management since no one  have heard from t=
he owner since 2008. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I=
 have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it; I am the only =
one that have the information.
=20
With the recent change of government in my country and with their effort=
s to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the Afri=
ca, before the end of this year, the government will pass a new financia=
l control law which will give the government authority to interrogate ac=
count owners of above 2,000,000.00 (GPB) to explain the source of the fu=
nds, making  sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this=
 money out of the country immediately, before the stipulated period the =
government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot =
provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. I cannot d=
irectly transfer out this money without your help, that is why I am cont=
acting you for assistance. As the Account Officer to late Mr. Zaachery c=
oupled with my present position and status in the bank as a Branch Manag=
er now, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any fo=
reigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correc=
t information concerning the account, which I shall give you. All docume=
nts to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there=
 is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under=
 a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law..
=20
I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so=
 that both of us will be satisfied. contact me as soon as you receive th=
is message with your=20
1) full Name.......................
2) phone number.......................
For a verbal discussion and Treat with utmost confidentiality.=20


I shall send you a copy of the depository Agreement certificate issued t=
o Mr. Zaachery when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your u=
rgent response. Get back to me through my private mail box; (mrthdavid@g=
mail.com) or call (+233 200 40 2806)
