Hi sugar,
Have not heard from you for ages! Have you forgotten about me? Hope not!

How are things going?


I am still single and spring has come.. all of my friends are hnaging out 
with their boyfriends and I am alone ..

I have registered my profile at http://znakomilka.com/?idAff=138 - 
why don't you come and see my new photos? And perhaps even email me..

Though we might get to know each other better and perhaps this Spring will 
be the last lonely spring for us?

Will be waiting:
