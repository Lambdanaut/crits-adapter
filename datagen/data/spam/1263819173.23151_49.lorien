Good day,

This message is directed to you for the purpose of a transaction that is worth £45,300,000.This transaction is completely legitimate and all legal documents will be provided which will cover you and the funds during the course of this transaction.

I am PAUL TUCKER  by name, Deputy Governor Financial Stability, Bank of England.  

http://www.bankofengland.co.uk 

 If you are interested in this transaction, I will advise you send me an email with the following details  to this email : paultuckeruk67@yahoo.com.hk

Full Name :

Tel Number:

Age:

Occupation :

Address :


The reason for these details to be released to me is for me to be sure I am not corresponding with the wrong person. Note that you are been contacted because of your family name and as such, I must be very sure someone else is not playing a fast one on either of us.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the
whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this
may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such
opportunities only come once in a lifetime.

I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for
this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have
here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.

If you would like to discuss further about this transaction that is in your family name as an inheritance that you 

will benefit from, email me back only on this email address :  paultuckeruk67@yahoo.com.hk

Note: Do not respond to this email address you received this message from because my server has a problem to send mails and so, I send you with my relative's email. Endeavour to respond only to the email address stated above. Your response will be highly appreciated at this point because this money has been delayed for too long and I would like to finalize the transaction as soon as possible so that I can go ahead with my other client's issues I have at stake.

Best Regards.

Paul  Tucker
