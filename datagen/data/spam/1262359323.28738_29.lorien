ATTENTION:  BENEFICIARY


This  e-mail  has  been  issued  to  you  in  order  to  Officially  inform  you  that  we  have  completed  an  investigation  on  an  International  Payment  in  which  was  issued  to  you  by  an  International  Lottery  Company.  With  the  help  of  our  newly  developed  technology  (International  Monitoring  Network  System)  we  discovered  that  your  e-mail  address  was  automatically  selected  by  an  Online  Balloting  System,  this  has  legally  won  you  the  sum  of  $800,000.00  USD  from  a  Lottery  Company  outside  the  United  States  of  America.  During  our  investigation  we  discovered  that  your  e-mail  won  the  money  from  an  Online  Balloting  System  and  we  have  authorized  this  winning  to  be  paid  to  you  via  a  Certified  Cashier's  Check.


Normally,  it  will  take  up  to  10  business  days  for  an  International  Check  to  be  cashed  by  your  local  bank.  We  have  successfully  notified  this  company  on  your  behalf  that  funds  are  to  be  drawn  from  a  registered  bank  within  the  United  States  Of  America  so  as  to  enable  you  cash  the  check  instantly  without  any  delay,  henceforth  the  stated  amount  of  $800,000.00  USD  has  been  written in a Bank of America Certified Cashier Check.


We  have  completed  this  investigation  and  you  are  hereby  approved  to  receive  the  winning  prize  as  we  have  verified  the  entire  transaction  to  be  Safe  and  100%  risk  free,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  funds  have  been  written in a Bank of America Certified Cashier Check  you  will  be  required  to  settle  the  following  bills  directly  to  the  Lottery  Agent  in-charge  of  this  transaction  whom  is  located  in  Lagos,  Nigeria.  According  to  our  discoveries,  you  were  required  to  pay  for  the  following  -


(1)  Deposit  Fee's  (  Fee's  paid  by  the  company  for  the  deposit  into  an  American  Bank  which  is  -  Bank  Of  America  )
(2)  Cashier's  Check  Conversion  Fee  (  Fee  for  converting  the  Wire  Transfer  payment  into  a  Certified  Cashier's  Check  )
(3)  Shipping  Fee's  (  This  is  the  charge  for  shipping  the  Cashier's  Check  to  your  home  address  )


The  total  amount  for  everything  is  $250  (Two Hundred and Fifty  Dollars).  We  have  tried  our  possible  best  to  indicate  that  this  $250  should  be  deducted  from  your  winning  prize  but  we  found  out  that  the  funds  have  already  been  written in a Bank of America Certified Cashier Check  and  cannot  be  accessed  by  anyone  apart  from  you  the  winner,  therefore  you  will  be  required  to  pay  the  required  fee's  to  the  Agent  in-charge  of  this  transaction  via  Western  Union  Money  Transfer  Or  Money  Gram.


In  order  to  proceed  with  this  transaction,  you  will  be  required  to  contact  the  agent  in-charge  (  Mr.  Robert Tailor)  via  e-mail.  Kindly  look  below  to  find  appropriate  contact  information:
