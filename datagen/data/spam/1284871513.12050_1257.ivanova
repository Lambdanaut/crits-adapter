My Dear,

I am sure this mail would be coming to you as a surprise since we have
never met before and you would also be asking why I have decided to chose
you amongst the numerous internet users in the world, precisely I cannot
say why I have chosen you but do not be worried for I come in peace and
something very positive is about to happen to your life right now and to
the lives of others through you if only you can carefully read and digest
the message below. The internet has made the world global villages where
you can reach anybody you have not met before.

Before I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography, I
am Mother Emilly Olivier, 87 Years old woman and the wife of Late Sir
Jackman Olivier who died in a Plane crash on Monday the 7th of September
1998 GMT 14:22 UK while they were flying from New York to Geneva. Please
see site below for more information.
http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/index.html

After the death of my husband I became the Head of his investment and now
that I am old and weak I have decided to spend the rest of my life with my
family and loved ones whom I never had time for during the course of my
business life, but before the death of my husband we had a plan to use the
last days of our lives to donate half of what we have worked for to the
less privilege and charity homes and the other half for ourselves, family
members and close friends, and it is so unfortunate that my husband is not
alive today to do this with me and I am very weak and old now, hence I
have decided to do this philanthropic work on behalf of my late husband
and I.

Presently, I have willed out almost half of our assets to several charity
homes and to some of the less privilege in different countries. Despite
the agreement between my late husband and I to give aid to the deprived,
we also agreed to render support to an individual we have not meet before
in life due to the fact when we were still young in life we receive an
anonymous help from an individual we did not know and which we have not
being able to know till date, the impact we got from such gesture made us
to do same.

I am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know me
because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I have
agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the beneficiary
of our last WILL, irrespective of your previous financial status, hence I
need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer that will cost you
nothing.

I have presently deposited a Cheque in the sum of 5,800,000.00 British
Pounds with DHL express to deliver to you, what you have to do now is to
contact the DHL COURIER SERVICE as soon as possible to know when they will
deliver your package to you because of the expiring date.

For your information, I have paid for the delivering Charge, Insurance
Premium and Clearance Certificate Fee of the Cheque showing that it is not
a Drug Money or meant to sponsor Terrorist attack in your Country

You have to contact the DHL COURIER SERVICE now for the delivery of your
cheque with this information bellow;
Contact Person:Mr. George Greg
Email Address: mr.gregdhl@gmail.com,


Tel: +44 703 599 663

Again, you are not to pay for the delivering Charge, the Insurance premium
and the Clearance Certificate Fee of the Cheque because I have already
paid for them, the only money you are expected to pay is 165 British
Pounds for the security keeping of the cheque so far.

I would have paid the fee but the company insisted that I should not
because they don't know when you will be contacting them and to avoid
demurrage or further cost.

You are to reconfirm the below information to them to avoid any mistake on
the Delivery.

Postal address;
Full Names:
Direct telephone number;

Below is the security keeping code: (SCT/0433/F) of your draft, you are to
also present it to them for verification before delivery.

Let me repeat again, try to contact them as soon as you receive this mail
to avoid any further delay and remember to ask them to provide you with
the method they wish to use in receiving their security keeping fee of 165
British Pounds for their immediate action.

Note: Please I do not want you to thank me or my husband all I need you to
do is to invest wisely with it and do the same good to someone’s
life someday as this is the only way this world would be a better
community if we render selfless services to one another.


Yours Faithfully
Mrs. Emilly Olivier Jackman
