<DIV><B>THE BRIDGE</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>There are two different opinions regarding to the emergence of=20=
this world, some people think this world with all live and all events=20=
would be a tiny part of the logical causal chain which started with the=
 big bang, the others are convinced of it, that it is finally the fault=
 of Adam and Eve because they have not observed the one holy law of God=
: "When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and=20=
pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took=20=
some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her=20=
. . ." According to this the big bang etc would be a willfully deceptio=
n of God, because without the doubt in God it wouldn't be possible to=20=
test the faith and unbelief of mankind and the sense of this world woul=
d get lost. In contrast to the religious view, a causal chain out of=20=
cause and effect can not have a beginning respectively not emerge out=20=
of nothing, this contradicts to the laws of science, therewith there's=20=
not only no cause before or for the big bang, but also no energy which=20=
would have been necessary for the big bang, even not a tiny disbalance=20=
between anything. If two fingers are pressed together, is nothing betwe=
en them or rather no matter, of course the universe, the human himself=20=
and the bright world which surrounds the human not emerged out of the=20=
completely harmless nothing between two fingers or without God, this=20=
are simply stories which were invented by some humans and which are bel=
ieved by children, if they are told to them early enough, in the first=20=
states of the USA such stories were deleted already successfully from=20=
the curriculum, so that they weren't taught any more to the children=20=
in the schools. Depriving children of their believe and religion is a=20=
serious crime, it's in the hands of our generation to stop the systemat=
ic and unfair education of many million children to the unbelieve!</B><=
/DIV>
<DIV><B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>If the big bang could have happened without God, practically=20=
everything could have emerged out of this, but this universe was build=20=
exactly so, that the suppositions for live are given, for example witho=
ut voltage no brainwaves could flow, without radiation this world would=
 be dark and ice-cold, without atoms and the possibility to build molec=
ules live would be impossible, the same would be without many other che=
mical properties and reactions or without elements like oxygen or carbo=
n or hydrogen or . . ., also the lost of time or movement or space or=20=
matter or the three states of matter or physical energy or chemical ene=
rgy or different agencies or continuity or . . . would make live finall=
y impossible. Without intelligence something absolute senseless would=20=
have emerged out of the big bang or out of nothing, but of course no=20=
live. Yes, the frightening recognition is, that the universe was constr=
ucted deliberately exactly so, that the suppositions for live and highe=
r live are given!</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>For the alleged chemical evolution of live, a first living and=20=
survivable unicellular organism would have been necessary, but a just=20=
10 =B5m large cell, a very complex, perfectly compound, three-dimension=
al puzzle or a survivable machine out of at least 10 quadrillion pieces=
 (16 g/mol), atoms of different kind and attribute, impossibly could=20=
be washed together in an unrealistic puddle out of cytoplasm, be bound=20=
together in the same second by many different chemical processes into=20=
a flexible unit and get enliven also in the same moment, to start to=20=
breathe, to eat, to grow . . . and to produce randomly complete and liv=
ing self-copies, which will grow up some day to intelligent structured=20=
humans. If we are honest we must admit, that even not only one single=20=
dead DNA strand could be washed together in a liquid or the belonging=20=
to copysystems, already the DNA strands of the first survivable cell=20=
must randomly have conformed exactly to the cell construction, beside=20=
this DNA strands are written in a very high programming language, until=
 today nobody can understand how or by which encoding systems this code=
s get transcribed into commands, movements and material constructions.=20=
Also for all the different cell organelles or sub-systems of the first=20=
survivable cell must have been directly there the belonging to copysyst=
ems or already the first cell division would have been impossible, but=20=
how high must be the technology of a material system which could copy=20=
itself, try to build a computer which could copy itself!</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>The functions of cells partially happen on the molecular and=20=
atomic level, if the dateless old atoms, out of which we and the cells=20=
are set together, would be as big as table tennis balls, an average hum=
an brain with 1250 to 1375 g would take in a little bit more space than=
 the whole planet earth with its diameter of 12700 km (13,5 g/mol, the=20=
volume of a table tennis ball is 33,5 cm^3), it's a wonder that a grown=
 machine of such complexity ever could work without going defect. If=20=
the 10 quadrillion atoms of a 10 =B5m large unicellular organism would=20=
be as big as table tennis balls, this unicellular organism would take=20=
in the whole city Tokyo by a hight of more than 500 meters. If God woul=
d build a machine out of 10 quadrillion atoms of different kind and att=
ribute, this machine wouldn't die any more after its commissioning, bec=
ause it really would start to breathe, to eat, to grow, to move . . .=20=
to survive independently in its world and to divide itself many trillio=
n times, to conquer the planet and to travel to the moon. If God would=20=
construct a machine with such properties, it would be so small, that=20=
we even couldn't see it with our multicellular eyes. We have got no ide=
a about the intelligence of God, the creator out of nothing, but surly=20=
it's not grateful to use the by God constructed brain to say, that a=20=
dirty puddle was the inventor of live.</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>A just 10 =B5m large unicellular organism is a very complex,=20=
perfectly compound, three-dimensional puzzle out of at least 10 quadril=
lion pieces of different kind and attribute, but a chemical evolution=20=
even wouldn't be able to wash correctly together a DNA string or a two-=
dimensional computer program character string out of 1000 signs, which=20=
is written with only 10 different letters, because with every sign, whi=
ch will be attached after the first sign, the probability that the prog=
ram was written correctly sinks by the factor 10, so the probability=20=
that a computer program out of 1000 signs will be written correctly by=20=
random or will be washed together in a dirty puddle is 10^1000 (a 1 wit=
h one thousand 0). In contrast to this, today we know, that the whole=20=
universe contains less than 10^100 atoms totally and that it is less=20=
than 10^18 seconds old. If the universe would be 100 times smaller or=20=
younger, the chance that the chemical evolution really happened would=20=
be 100 times less, if the 1000 sign computer program would be 100 times=
 shorter, the chance that the chemical evolution really happened would=20=
be 100 times bigger, so we can stroke out the zeros: 10^1000 - 10^100=20=
- 10^18 =3D 10^882. We have reduced the whole universe to one atom and=20=
an age of one second through only 118 letters! So the iron proof for=20=
the absolute impossibility of a chemical evolution was written down!</B=
></DIV>
<DIV><B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV><B>Obviously a long time ago was created a world which seems to=20=
be produced and controlled by random and in which we can decide without=
 the fear of God, so it would be good to decide just like Jesus would=20=
have done! The Jews, the Christians and the Muslims they all believe=20=
in Adam and Eve and in the same God, but they are also self-righteous=20=
and brave enough just to believe and to die in the religion in which=20=
they were randomly born in, God has made the humans like this, at least=
 God is justly, so God can' t judge the humans therefore. Can't? The=20=
5th gospel of the Bible, the Barnabas gospel, was removed out of the=20=
Bible because a prophet called Ali was predicted by Jesus as the "Parac=
lete", which shall bring new laws of God. Ali was the second name of=20=
Mohammed, for over thousand years a secret was made out of this. Accord=
ing to the published gospels, the "Paraclete" is the Spirit of truth=20=
which goes out from God, therewith could also be meant the archangel=20=
Gabriel, which transmitted the Quran to Mohammed. In an other, still=20=
existing part of the Bible is Mohammed predicted through God himself=20=
(5.Moses 18:18,19): "I will raise up for them a prophet like you (Mose)=
 from among their brothers (the brothers of the Jews respectively the=20=
Israelites are the Ismaelites: Abraham &gt; Ismael &gt; Mohammed), I=20=
will put my words in his mouth (the Quran is the only book of God himse=
lf), and he will tell them everything I command him." Statements of God=
 himself never leave room for doubts. Abraham had two sons, Ismael and=20=
Isaac, Ismael became the grandfather of the Ismaelites (the Arabs) and=20=
his brother Isaac became the grandfather of the Israelites (the Jews).=20=
Ismael was born as son of Abraham and the Egyptian handmaid Hadschar,=20=
Hadschar has found the well Zamzam in Mecca when her son Ismael nearly=20=
died of thirst. Ismael's descendant Mohammed was a very friendly person=
 and initially a sheepherder, the Quran was transmitted to Mohammed thr=
ough the archangel Gabriel, Mohammed himself was an illiterate. Isaac,=20=
the second son of Abraham which he had with Sara, was the ancestor of=20=
many prophets up to Jesus. God has also given real proofs for the truth=
fulness of the Islam, so that misunderstandings can be avoided, for exa=
mples, it was impossible for Mohammed to know 1400 years ago, that the=20=
universe expands since the big bang and that it theoretically must coll=
apse again in the same way or that the water of the Atlantic Ocean and=20=
the water of the Mediterranean Sea not get merged with each other as=20=
if an invisible barrier would be between them or that the mountains are=
 anchored far below in the earth, so that the continental plates are=20=
hold by them in their position or in which phases a microscopically sma=
ll embryo get developed during the pregnancy or that Christianity wars=20=
will really happen in future exactly like prophesied (</B><A href=3D"ht=

nging to text parts in the Quran are marked additionally with the note,=
 that this is a sign of God for the humans, so that it's sure, that thi=
s is definitely not a coincidence, but knowledge. Even the Buddhists=20=
and the Hindu people must admit, that this really is a wonder. Beside=20=
the Quran, were written down the sayings of Mohammed, this so-called=20=

A><B>&nbsp;through which the mistrustful people became believers, it's=20=
also evident, that that what was prophesied really got fulfilled. Throu=
gh a nightly ascension Mohammed was shown the Temple Mount of Israel=20=
and the Gardens of Paradise which shall be unimaginable beautiful, he=20=
told his followers, that even a space in Paradise, not bigger than a=20=
foot, is better than the whole world and whatever is in it. He also sai=
d, that one hour in the eternal Paradise will be greater than a whole=20=
life in this world ever could be and that the nice smell of Paradise=20=
can be perceived from a walking distance of forty years. Some people=20=
will even get access to Paradise for simply having an atoms weight of=20=
faith. The live in this world seems to be real and its existence is als=
o only a wonder, so are we the causal chain out of nothing, a network=20=
in the dark which thinks about itself and starts to believe in God or=20=
are we made by an unimaginable high intelligence? Believe is the light=20=
in our head and we shall move into this light! Freedom is if we recogni=
ze and do what God want and that what we can reach for God in this worl=
d means richness for us in the eternal Paradise! Some humans will be=20=
happy for 100 years and some will be sad for 100 years, but when this=20=
life ends will the eternity begin, so why to life for a worthless dust=20=
particle when it comes about the entire universe. Happy New Year 2010!<=
