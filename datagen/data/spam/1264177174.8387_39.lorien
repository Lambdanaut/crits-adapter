I am Mr. George Vaughan manager claims department with Lloyds Bank here in London United Kingdom. I wish to notify you again that you were listedas a beneficiary to the total sum of Twelve Million Five Hundred thousand British pounds in the codicil and last testament of the deceased. (Name now withheld since this is our second letter to you).  

I am contacting you because you bear the surname identity and therefore I can present you as the beneficiary to the inheritance. I therefore reckoned that you can receive these funds as you arequalified by your name identity. 

All the legal papers that will be used to process the payment will be handled by me, in your acceptance to co-operate with me on this deal.  

Kindly forward to me your letter of acceptance; and confirm your full name, current telephone and fax numbers and a forwarding address to enable me file in necessary documents at our high court probate division for the release of this sum of money to you.  

Please contact me via my private email: gvaughan1940@9.cn so we can get this done immediately. 

Yours faithfully, 
Mr. George Vaughan.
