Dear Friend,

I could not contact you earlier before now due to my tight schedules. I am very happy to inform you about my success in getting that money under the cooperation of a new partner from England Presently. I am in England with the partner for some projects with the money.

Meanwhile,I did not forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in that process despite that it failed us at that time. due to no trust. Now, I want you to contact my secretary,her name is Mrs Bimbo Johnson and her email address is ( bimbo.johnson@rediffmail.com )

Arrange with her how the total sum of ( USD $560,300 ) will reach you safely which I have already kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much.

So feel free to get in touch with my secretary miss Bimbo Johnson and discuss with her how the amount will reach you. Please do let me know immediately you contact her to receive it so that we can share the joy after all the sufferness at that time. As at the moment,I am very busy here because of the projects which I and the new partner are have at hand.

Finally,remember that I had forwarded instruction to my secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with her and she will send the amount to you without any delay.

Best regards,
Mr. Kojo Williams
