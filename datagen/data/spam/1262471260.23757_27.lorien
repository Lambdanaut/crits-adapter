Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am Evangelist Lindy Mike, The daughter of Late Sherrif Kindimbu from Weste Africa Nigeria.I am 34years old,my mother is From England,while my father is from Nigeria,i am an halfcast (White Girl) i was married to Late John Mike from England, i am now a new christian convert,suffering from long time concer problem. 
 
From all indications, my condition is serious and according to my late husband doctor it is quite obvious that i may not survive the sickness,as a christian,i beleived God and i know that i will not die,i will leave to declare the glory of God, My late Husband Mr.John Mike is From England,he and my only son was killed by his family members,because he does not agree with them, i am presently leaving alone.Our Lord Jesus Christ is my comforter.
 
Before the death of my husband,he told me on his sick bed that he deposited some money with the United Bank for Africa plc(UBA) in Nigeria, the sum of Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (Usd$15.5M).After disclosing this secret to me,he gave me the Documents he used in Depositing the fund called Certificate of Deposit,he never wanted to tell me about it until the present moment that he was about to die,he told me that his reason for telling me about this fund secretly is because after his death that he knows his family will not allow me to inherit any of his wealth or property.
 
He told me that Nigerian Government will not allow me to make this claim since i am a citizen of Nigeria,my husband told me that i can only get the fund claimed through the help of a foreigner like you,and that was exactly what happened,I made up my mind to travel abroad to leave the rest of my life and continue to do the work of God as a missionary,I called my late husband lawyer to find out if the fund is still in contact in that bank, to enable me raise some money to continue my mission,to my greatest surprise it was still in contact.
 
Presently,all the Documents concerning the FUND are with me, now that my sickness has gone to this stage,I am scared and I want the fund to be used for the work of God all over the world,i have prayed and told God to direct me to an honest christian who will receive this fund and utilise it together with me and for things that will glorify the name of God,after my prayers,I decided to contacted you alone my beloved in Christ. 
 
Please I will appreciate that you send the following information to enable my late Husband Lawyer commence with the procuring of the necessary document that will  back you up as next of kin to my late Husband for immediate arrangement with the UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA UBA Plc on how the Fund Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (Usd$15.5M) will be claimed by you on my Late Husbands Behalf as his Next of Kin and New Beneficiary.
