Dear friend,

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains. My name is Mr. Stanley Alan John, a merchant in London, but taking treatment in Amsterdam, now I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal cancer that was discovered very late due to lack of caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business.

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. Recently, I use to say to myself that if God should give me a second chance I would have live it differently way from how I have lived. I was meditating on my hospital bed and something told me that God is giving me a second chance by keeping me alive though doctors said I won’t last long. I know my time is near, that’s why I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as some few close friends.

I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, London and Ireland. And I have also met two people on the net who have helped me distribute money to charity organizations in their country. Now my health is deteriorating so badly, I really need you to help me distribute the last of my fortune. You might be wondering why I did not ask my close relatives to pick over this task. But I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organizations in Bulgaria; they closed the account but refused to donate the money to the organizations, some of them even fled away with some of the money while the rest shared the remaining among money among themselves. From the way they are acting around me tells that they want me dead so that they can talk about inheritance.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be content with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is a huge cash deposit that I have with a bank abroad will be put in your care if only you will agree. I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Mr. Stanley Alan John that is making this generous donation. I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my time to come. I pray for you to support and assist me with a good heart.

But the choice is yours Please you can contact me through email.

Be blessed my beloved,
Mr. Stanley Alan John
