I anticipate that you read this mail quickly and let me know your opinion or willingness on this classified information that&nbsp; I will release to you. Firstly, I am a happily married man with 3 kids and therefore I would not want to jeopardize this opportunity to change my financial status that will give my family a secured future.</DIV>

I am Mr.Albert Kobina Essien, the branch manager of the Eco Bank Of Ghana Limited, First Light Branch Accra. I am 48 years of age.&nbsp; It may interest you to hear that I am a man of PEACE and don't want problem, but I don't know how you will feel about this, but I am telling you that this is real and you are not going to regret after doing this transaction with me.I only hope we can assist each other. But if you don't want this business offer kindly forget it.</DIV>

I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us, as the branch manager of the Eco Bank Of Ghana Limited; it is my duty to send in a financial report to my head office in the capital city Accra-Ghana at the end of each year.On the course of the last two years 2008 end of the year report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the Manager made Twelve Million Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars [12,850.000.00] which my head office are not aware of and will never be aware of, Nor must they know that I am involved in this transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I have since place this fund on what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without any beneficiary.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
As an officer of the Bank I can not be directly connected to this money, so this informed my contacting you for us to work so that you can assist receive this money into your bank account for us to SHARE, while you will have 35% of the total fund. Note there are practically no risk involved, it will be bank to bank transfer, all I need from you is to stand claim as the original depositor of this fund who made the deposit with our branch so that my Head office can order the transfer to your designated bank account.</DIV>
<DIV>
