 USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr Raymond Werner who 
worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the 
year 2005.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a 
brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born 
again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child 
outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was 
alive he deposited the sum of 18Million Dollars eighteen Million United State 
Dollars with one finance/security Company in Europe 
Presently this money is still with the Security Company. Recently my Doctor told 
me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though 
what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided 
to donate this Fund to church or better still a Christian individual that will 
utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that 
will use this fund to fund churches orphanages and widows propagating the word 
of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. 
The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth I took this 
decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my 
husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned 
money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money 
will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I 
know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. 
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. 
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and 
because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want 
them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give 
you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Europe I will also issue you 
a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this 
Fund.. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my 
shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever 
that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always 
be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in 
sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please 
assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. 

Hoping to hearing from you soon.

I have set aside 20% for you and for your time and 10% for any expenses if there 
is any.
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Yours in Christ 

Mrs. joannna Werner
