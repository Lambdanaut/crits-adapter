Dear Friend,
 
I am Mr.Kwasi Tumi staff of CAL bank Ghana.I am contacting you in 
respect to a financial portfolio of Ten Million United States Dollars (US $10 
Million) deposited in a security firm whose  depositor died in mid 2007.As the 
Head, Foreign (International) Operations Unit, the investigating team has for 
the past years been fruitless to locate my late client, If you are familiar 
with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer 
anonymity and also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In 
his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. If nobody comes forward to claim 
the deposit, the Security firm will by the end of its financial year in 2010 
revert the deposit back to CAL Bank. This will result in the money entering 
the CAL Bank accounting system.
 
The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those 
that occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; the security firm 
has no single idea of the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply 
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that come forward. I 
would have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that will 
draw a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. But 
introducing you as a relative with the right to claim the deposit as a next of 
kin will mask my involvement and participation in diverting the deposit for 
personal use. I assure you that all the documents needed to effect this claim 
will be given to you immediately you notify me of your acceptance to partner 
with me in claiming this deposit for our mutual benefit. I am ready 
tointroduce you to my bank as the closest surviving relation; upon successful 
delivery of the deposit to you. 

We share the money equally 50/50. 
 
If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me 
 
Regards
Mr.Kwasi Tumi
