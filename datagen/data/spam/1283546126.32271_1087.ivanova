Dear Friend,
I have a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$55 Million Dollars, which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded with 30% of the total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?

Chairman CEO: Yukos Oil Corporation, 31a, Dubininskaya str.Moscow 115054, Russia(Russian Most Largest Oil Company)Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank 
(A well reputable financial institution with its branches all over the world)

SOURCE OF FUNDS:

The documents of the above funds in question was handed over to me to be used in payment of an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with my boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have been deposited with a bank outside Russia, where the final crediting is expected to be carried out.
While I was on the process, My Boss was arrested for his involvement on politics in financing the leading and opposing political parties
(the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat to FORMER President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian President. You can catch more of the story on this:

YOUR ROLE:
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Bank 
transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to relocate to U.A.E continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
conglomerates so as to free my self from the hands of the present government. The transaction has to be concluded in 7 days upon the receipt of 
your response to me. As soon as I get your willingness to comply I will give you more details and also tell you what I shall require from you. 
Finally I will let you know my location in Europe and where this fund is at present for security reasons. Kindly reply to the below email address if interested.
