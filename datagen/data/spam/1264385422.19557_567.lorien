Good Day,


I am Mr. Martin Sean the Director in charge of Auditing section of Hsbc In Malaysia .

Am sorry if this message comes to you as a surprise. I have decided to contact you on a project that will be very beneficial to both of us.
During our auditing in this Bank, I came across some amount of fund laying in wait here, and when I carried out my investigation, I discovered that it was an overdraft that was perfected by the formal Auditor whom I took over the office from, he was unable to move out this huge sum of money due to the urgency that was attached to his dismissal from the office.  And the said fund is US$7.1 Million United Stated Dollar.

I am in search of a reliable person who can put up a claim on this fund, so that it will  be transferred to his/her account  for both of us to use it for an Investment purpose, right now I have successfully moved the fund to an escrow Account in one of the Local Banks here in Malaysia. Upon your acceptance to carry on this task more information will be made known to you.

Please you have been advised to keep "top-secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I conclude this deal with you. I will fly down to your country or any place we shall agreed on for subsequent negotiation regarding the investment and it’s benefits immediately this fund has being transferred into your designated Bank Account.

Upon your acceptance to this proposal, kindly get back to me via this e-mail: martinsean@sify.com


I look forward to receive your urgent reply.
