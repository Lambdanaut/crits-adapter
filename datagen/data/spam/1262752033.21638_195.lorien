Dear  Sir/Madam,


With due respect, trust and humility, I write this letter to you seeking
your help and assistance, Though its difficult since we have not met
before, I got your good contact from the network online while browsing
through website of business opportunities in your country.



I believe that you are capable and reliable in handling this urgent
international transaction of this sort.

I am Dato’ Abdul Rahman, Barrister at law. A deceased client of mine, By
name Mr Robert Eich, Who here in after shall be referred to as my client,
Died as the result of a heart-related condition in November 2004.



His heart condition was due to the death of all the members of his family
in the Concord Air Flight Crash Aired July 31, 2000 - 14:22 UK . ET as
reportedon:View websites below.



http://news.bbc.co..uk/1/hi/ world/europe/859479.stm

I have contacted you to assist in distributing the money left behind by my
client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank
where this deposit valued at ($ 3.5, million) US Dollars is lodged.

This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, Or the
account will be confiscated. My proposition to you is to seek your consent
to present you as the next-of-kin and beneficiary of my late client since
you have the same last name with him, So that the proceeds of this account
can be paid to you. Then we can share the amount on a mutually agreed-upon
percentage.

All legal documents to back up your claim as my client's next of kin will
be secured gradually and forwarded to you.

All I require is your honest co.operation to enable us see this
transaction through.This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law.

If this business proposition offends your moral values,do accept my apology..

Please contact me at once to indicate your interest via my private e-mail.

Barr.Dato’ Abdul Rahman Esq
