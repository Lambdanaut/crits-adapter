Good Day,

Pardon me for not having the pleasure of knowing your mindset before making you this offer as it is utterly 
confidential and genuine by virtue of its nature. I write to solicit your assistance in a funds transfer deal 
involving US$3.5M.

This fund has been stashed out of the excess profit made last year by my branch office the International 
Commercial Bank which I am the manager. I have already submitted an approved end of the year report for 
the year 2008 to my head office here in Accra-Ghana and they will never know of this excess. I have since 
then, placed this amount in a Non-Investment Account without a beneficiary. 

Upon your response, I will configure your name on our database as holder of the Non-Investment Account. 
I will then guide you on how to apply to my head office for the Account Closure/ bank-to-bank remittance of 
the funds to your designated bank account. 

If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 30% of the funds while 70% shall be for me. 

Kindly forward your response to: {mrfrank_wuddah@naseej.com}

Regards, 
Mr. Frank Wuddah.
