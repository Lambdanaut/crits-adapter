Ther myself any further about the matter." She seemed to be very angry
at the old detective. He strode after her. "Wait a moment longer!" he
exclaimed. "No. I have no more to say," she replied, sharply. "Don't
attempt to follow me. If you do, it will be as much as your life is
worth." "Humbug!" he replied. "So you doubt me, eh? Well, look behind
you." He glanced over his shoulder and caught view of the shadowy
figures of several men lurking about the trees lining the street. Old
King Brady was astonished. She evidently had a body-guard of watchful
men. "Who are those people?" he demanded. "My friends," she replied,
quietly. "If they saw you attack or follow me, they would put a sudden
end to your career at long range." "By firing?" "Yes." "Let me walk as
far as the corner with you." "Very well, Mr. Brady. I have no objection
to that." The journey was made in utter silence, and the old detective
noticed that the shadowy men were following them. When they reached the
corner, Old King Brady glanced around, looking for Harry, who agreed to
meet him there. The boy was nowhere in sight. Old King Brady then
coughed and dropped his handkerchief as a signal. For a moment there was
no notice paid to it, but presently he heard a distant hissing sound of

ungrateful for your kindness. On the contrary, I appreciate it very
much. But my duty compels me to pay no heed to your valuable warning. I
must run down my quarry. Good-night, madam." "Good-night, sir." He
tipped his hat and strode away to the Walker House, where he was
staying. She stood watching him until he was several blocks distant and
then gave vent to a low, peculiar whistle. Instantly four men came
gliding from the shadows, and grouped around her, as she started to walk
away. She was heading for the railroad depot. When she was gone, Harry
Brady slid down from the dense foliage of a nearby tree where he had
been a hidden watcher. The boy had seen the woman and her body-guard,
and knew that his partner wanted him to shadow her from that point.
Accordingly he glided along after them. Dodging from tree to tree,
slinking along in the densest shadows and never exposing
