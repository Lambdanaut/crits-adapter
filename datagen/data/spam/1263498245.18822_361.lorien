Dear Friend,

An Iraqi made a fixed deposit of U$D6.5 Million in
my bank branch (Hang Seng Bank, Hong Kong) where
I am a director and he died with his entire family
in the war leaving behind no next of kin.

I am ready to share 50/50 with you if you choose to stand as my
deceased client next of kin. If interested mail me at
the address below.

Email Contact: wongttangyu@livemail.tw
Yours Truly,
Wong Tang.
