THIS IS AN OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION OF FUNDS DEPOSITED IN YOUR 
NAME AND IT IS NOT A SALES SOLICITATION.

We are Diplomats that arrange for the safekeeping of special and valuable packages and baggage in trust 
for reputable clients that are honest and trustworthy. We work in collaboration with top firms and Governments 
of various countries as we have earned a name as a service whose hallmarks in reliability and confidentiality 
are revered. International missions, Fellow Diplomats and Embassies of the world have used our services to 
satisfaction.

A benefactor whose identity can not be disclosed because of the Non Circumvention and Non Disclosure Agreement that was signed with the said benefactor when the funds were being deposited, made you the beneficiary of a package containing some amount of money and stated clearly that you should only be contacted when the time signed for it to be in our care elapses and the time has already elapsed that is why you are being contacted.

The Non Circumvention and Non Disclosure Agreement signed with the benefactor mandates us to fully divulge and disclose the benefactor's identity 18 months after you, the beneficiary, has received the funds.

The funds totals $7.5M (Seven Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) and we confirm that these funds are

arranged to be brought to your Country of residence by Diplomats who would accompany you to your bank (if you want them to) to deposit the funds in your name and submit all documentations of proof of the origin of the funds in other to exonerate you from any form of investigations or interrogation and to authenticate the fact that the funds are clean and has no links whatsoever with either drugs or terrorism.
