Orge, smiling. Little Bessie, with clean apron, and flaxen hair nicely
tied up with ribbons, was rather shy of the stranger. "She'th dirty,"
lisped she, pointing to her feet. "Well, s'pose she is?" retorted
William. "I guess _you_'d be dirty, too, if you'd been running about in
the mud, without any shoes. But she's pretty. She's like my black
kitten, only she a'n't got a white nose." Willie's comparison was
received with shouts of laughter; for there really was some resemblance
to the black kitten in that queer little face. But when the small mouth
quivered with a grieved expression, and she clung closer to Willie, as
if afraid, kind Uncle George patted her head, and tried to part the
short, thick, black hair, which would not stay parted, but insisted upon
hanging straight over her eyebrows. Baby Emma had been wakened in her
cradle by the noise, and began to rub her eyes out with her little

funny-looking thing!" He halted suddenly before the small stranger, gave
a slight whistle, and exclaimed,-- "Halloo! here's a funny-looking
prairie-puss!" "She a'n't a prairie-puss," cried Willie, pushing him
back with doubled fists. "She's a little girl; and she's _my_ little
girl. I found her." "She's a great find," retorted the roguish brother,
as he went behind her, and pulled the long black hair that fell over her
shoulders. "Now you let her alone!" shouted Willie;
