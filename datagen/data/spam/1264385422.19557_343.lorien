BE ADVISED ACCORDINGLY
 
Be informed that my previous mail to you was not responded to.Due to the importance of this matter,i found it necessary to write you once more.
 
It may interest you to know a comprehensive search revealed your last name to be same with a customer of the SNS Bank (now deceased) whom my bank’s efforts to locate his relatives/family members have been unsuccessful. The benefit from this dormant account worth millions in dollars is awaiting payment to a potential heir/beneficiary.
 
Putting into consideration my job as the head of compensation and benefits and the legal requirement of claims like this, your last name can pass for a heir to this huge amount. You need not worry about the legal requirement as you shall be closely guided and directed on this.
 
Kindly respond with your name as stated in your driver's license or international passport and your direct telephone number to signify interest.
 
Be advised to keep this very important notice to yourself until advised otherwise.
 
Yours Faithfully,
Chris Veenstra
