<BODY><b>A car store seeks remote employees.</b><br>
What is the essence of the job being offered: car sale ads appear in your city and our customers want to purchase these cars. <br>
A small prepayment is usually made to the seller to reserve the vehicle for our customer.<br>
However, recently, there have been some swindlers who offer non-existent cars and disappear after receiving the prepayment.<br>
In order to eliminate this risk factor, we hire employees in all cities to verify such sale information.<br>
How this is done - we agree beforehand on a trip date, send you passport information of both the seller and car,<br>
and you need to come (within your city limits, no further) and check if the actual information complies with that supplied by us.<br>
<br>
You need to check the seller's documents, vehicle papers and whether the car actually exists.<br>
<b>You get $50 to 300 for this simple assignment.</b><br>
Since this check is subject to the interest of our customers in a car purchase, any 'false' (unpaid) trips are excluded.<br>
Number of trips per week:  from 1-2 (at the beginning of work) to 5-7 (after the first probation month).<br>
<br>
<b>Benefits:</b><br>
1. Officially contracted job<br>
2. Travel expenses covered + monthly bonuses<br>
3. Earnings in addition to your current job<br>
4. No need to sell anything or look for customers<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b><br>
1. Mobile and stationary phone<br>
2. Access to e-mail via Internet or mobile phone<br>
3. Minimum age: 21 <br>
<br>
