<div style=3D"margin-top:0.07in;"><SPAN style=3D"font-family:'bookman old=
 style';font-size:12pt;">I am Mr. Rufai Garba, the director of account/audit=
 department in the Bank of Africa Ouagadougou Burkina Faso, West Africa . I=
 got your contact from a Yahoo Tourist Search When I was searching for a=
 foreign partner. I assured of your capability and reliability to champion=
 this business opportunity when I prayed to the Almighty about you. In my=
 department we discovered an abandoned sum of $22,000.000.00 million US=
 Dollars (Twenty two million US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one=
 of our foreign customer Mr. Alan Williams, A British National who died=
 along with his entire family in (20 Oct 2005) in a plane crash. As followed=
 in this link</SPAN><SPAN style=3D"font-family:'bookman old=

PAN style=3D"font-family:'bookman old style';font-size:12pt;"> <br /><br=
 />Since I got the information about his death, we have been expecting his=
 next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it=
 unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased=
 as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all=
 his supposed next of kin relation died alongside with him at the plane=
 crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. </SPAN></div>
<div style=3D"margin-top:0.07in;"><SPAN style=3D"font-family:'bookman old=
 style';font-size:12pt;">It is therefore upon this discovery that I now=
 decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you=
 as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent=
 disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to=
 go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline=
 here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the=
 money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. <br=
 /><br />The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is=
 occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and I cannot stand=
 as next of kin to a foreigner since I am from this country. I agree to=
 offer you 45% of the total sum as foreign partner in respect to the=
 provision of an account, 55% will be for me while we both will take care of=
 the expenses incur during process of the transfer. </SPAN></div>
<div style=3D"margin-top:0.07in;"><SPAN style=3D"font-family:'bookman old=
 style';font-size:12pt;">There after I will visit your country for=
 disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable=
 the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply=
 first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating=
 your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax=
 number for easy and effective communication and location where the money=
 will be remitted. <br /><br />Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to=
 you by email the text of the application which you fill and send to our=
 bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is=
 hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all=
 required arrangements have been made for the transfer. </SPAN></div>
<div style=3D"margin-top:0.07in;"><SPAN style=3D"font-family:'bookman old=
 style';font-size:12pt;">You have to keep everything secret as to enable the=
 transfer to move very smoothly into the account you will provide to the=
 bank. </SPAN></div>
<div style=3D"margin-top:0.07in;"><SPAN style=3D"font-family:'bookman old=
 style';font-size:12pt;">Don't hesitate to furnish me with your private=
 telephone for easy and effective communication. Also send me your personal=
 information as followed <br /><br />(1) Your full names <br />(2) Your age=
 and occupation <br />(3) Your nationality <br />(4) Your private telephones=
 for easy communication <br />(5) A copy of your international passport or=
