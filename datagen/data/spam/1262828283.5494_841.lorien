I am Mr. Shung Hin Hui Edwin a manager on investor relations in
Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong. I have a business
suggestion for you.

Transfer of deposited funds from one of our late customer Yashua
Mageed Hedaya who was a politician and also business man made
a numbered cash lodgement for 24 months, with a value of Fifteen
millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars without
declaring any next of kin before his death since 2005, to your
own nominated  account we shall share in the ratio of 60% for
me, 40% for you.

My suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to
stand as the next of kin to Yashua Mageed Hedaya so that
you will be able to receive his funds.
Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue

If interested send your response to my personal email address:
mr.shung_edw@yahoo.com.hk

I Greet,
Shung Hin Hui Edwin.
