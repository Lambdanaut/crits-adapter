Attention: Beneficiary.

My name is Dr. Jerry Oman of the International Monetary Fund investigation unit. A petition was received and forewarded to our office here in London UK today the 1ST of SEPT, 2010 requesting that your unclaimed fund be paid to Janet Wlliams.

In the said letter of change of beneficiary/ownership, representatives of Janet Wlliams states that you are dead and as such your fund should be paid to her as the next of kin to you.

Because of the elaborate global scam, we decided to contact you for confirmation. If after seven working days, no responce is received from you, it will be assumed that you are dead and as such authorization and approval will be granted on behalf of Janet Wlliams to claim/receive your fund.

Reconfirm your Information and how you want your fund paid to you without further delay if you are still alive. Send your responce to my email ddress: pppppplimit1@yahoo.co.jp
