http://cid-3b7c3d04d16091b4.spaces.live.comHello Nathan!But what about al=
l their planes? There might be one packet missing. Which would you rather=
 smell? He almost dove behind the boulder. The planes were coming on stea=
dily. Say it again. All will be well. But Anselmo brought them well.We wi=
ll hobble them. What we do not have is time. Berrendo and the sniper watc=
hed him. Let me do it alone. Thou hast no heart but mine. Do not talk of =
it. Ask Pilar for it. Captain Mora got down from the boulder.The old man =
looked over his shoulder. FIXING THE NETS. We could prove nothing against=
 him. So to-morrow we disappear into the unknown. He seemed an uppish old=
 bird. No answering greeting came back to me. That is his most dangerous =
subject. My only possible chance lay in flight. Your words brought you su=
ddenly above it.He was a man of talent. Lyons flushed with anger again. W=
hat has he done? And what can I look forward to? We were on the same staf=
f once. Something terrible lay that way. Even Fascists whom we must kill.
