From Miss Merit Bilin
Abidjan-Cote d'lvoire 
West Africa. 

Hello, 

Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you as your profile pushed me to have confident in you and i know that you will not let me down. 
I am miss Merit Bilin the only daughter of late Mr and Mrs Butler Bilin,my father was a very wealthy gold and diamond merchant in Abidjan ,the economic capital of lvory coast before he was piosoned to death by his business associates on one of their outing to discuss on a business deal. 
I lost my dearly beloved mother when i was 6 years old and since then i was the only comfort to my father.
My late father left for me the sum of $1,500.000 million in a suspence account in a local bank here in Abidjan which he used my name as his only child for the next of kin in deposit of the fund. 
Before he died he also explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount
 of money his business associates supposed to balance him from the deal they had that he was piosoned by his business associates, that i should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where i will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose.
He also adviced me to be kind to the less previlledged people.
I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways. 
1) To provide a bank account where this money would be transferred to. 
2) To serve as the guardian of this fund since i am a girl of 22 years. 
3) Assist me to join you over there as i have no plan of settling down here any longer.
Moreover, i am willing to offer you 20% of the sum as compensation for effort input after the successful transfer of this fund to your designate account overseas. 
Anticipating to hear from you as soon as possible through my private email :

Thanks and God bless you.
Merit Bilin.
