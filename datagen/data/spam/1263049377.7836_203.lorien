As lawyers to the deceased we cannot lay claim to this funds which is about to be forfeited to the British Crown because the bank  account has been dormant for the proceeding Six years without claim and according to the British law, the money will revert to the treasury of the British government if nobody applies to claim the funds within the next six months with a satisfactory proof of claim.
