Privet, gentleman

Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness. If only you 
knew how my heart overflows with love for you. If only you could see 
the way you feel my hopes and dreams. You are the owner of my heart, 
the ruler supreme, no matter that we still did not meet I am faithful 
to you already. Even in the dark night I’ve only to think about you 
to feel your loving light and from this world I drift feeling as if 
I will never touch the ground again. If only you knew. If only you 
could guess how I hear your voice when others speak. It is you whom 
my soul seeks in every face. If only you could feel how just your 
image has the power to heal. I am willing to give you my all and 
expect nothing in return http://natalylove.net/hilove/
But oh how I yearn for you. If only you knew...

Waiting for your response
Ya
