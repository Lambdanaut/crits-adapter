Dear Partner,

I guess this letter may come to you as surprise since I had no previous
correspondence with you.

I am the Chairman of the Electoral Commission Ghana (EC). I got your
contact in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential
transaction involving the transfer of the sum of $14.500.000 Dollars
(Fourteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) the above
fund is not connected with arms, drugs or money laundering. It is the
product of an over invoiced contract awarded in 2008 by (EC) to a foreign
company for the supply of electoral materials that were used for
conducting the 2008 elections.

The contract has long been executed and payment of the actual contract
amount has been made to the foreign contractor leaving the balance of
$14.5 million which my colleagues and I now want to transfer out of Ghana
into a reliable foreign account for our personal use.

As civil servants we are not allowed to run foreign accounts.
Hence we have chosen to front and support you as the beneficiary to this
funds. If you are interested in the proposal kindly get back to me by
sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct telephone and
fax numbers, we have decided to share the money in the following
percentage, 60% for us 30% for you the account owner and 10% for all local
and international expenses that may arise in the course of this
transaction. Further details about this transaction will be discussed in
subsequent correspondence.

Note also that the particular nature of your business is irrelevant to
this transaction and this transaction is expected to be concluded within 5
working days since all local contacts and arrangements are in place for a
smooth and successful conclusion of this transaction.

Contact me via email with your contact telephone and fax numbers, so that I
can call you for a discussion.

Thank you as I await your response.

yours faithfully,
Dr.Kwadwo Afari
