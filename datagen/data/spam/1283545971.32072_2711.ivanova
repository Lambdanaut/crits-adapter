Greetings!!
 
I am sure this mail would come to you as a surprise since we have never met
before and you would also be asking why I have decided to choose you amongst the numerous internet users in the world. I cannot say why I have chosen you but don't be bothered about this, for I come in peace and something positive,which will affect your life and the lives of others for good. The internet has made the world a global village where you can reach anybody you have not met before.
 
Before I proceed, I am Mother Emily Olivier, 87 Years old and the wife of Late Sir Jackman Olivier who died in a Plane crash on Monday the 7th of September 1998 GMT 14:22 UK while flying from New York to Geneva. You may confirm this from this link http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/index.html
 
After the death of my husband, I headed his investment and now that I am old  I have decided to spend the rest of my life with my family and relatives whom I never had time for during my active business life. Before the death of my husband, we had plans to use the last days of our lives to disburse part of our resources to serve the needs of the less-privileged and whatever left for ourselves and relatives. But unfortunately, my husband is  not alive today to do this with me, hence  I have decided it on behalf of my late  husband and I.
 
I have willed out half of our assets to charities in different countries. In addition to the agreement between my late husband and I to give aid to the deprived, we resolved to positively touch the life of  an individual we have not met in life, the reason being that when we were younger  we received help from an unknown individual, whom we have not met till this day. The impact we got from such gesture made us to do same to you now.
 
I am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know me because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I have agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the beneficiary of our last WILL,irrespective of your previous financial status I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer that will cost you nothing.
