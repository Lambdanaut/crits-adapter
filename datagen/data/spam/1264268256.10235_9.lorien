Corporated by a Royal Charter, and it was confirmed by succeeding
monarchs. A change of title occurred in 1540, and it was then named the
Company of Barber-Surgeons. Holbein painted a picture of Henry VIII. and
the Barber-Surgeons. The painting is still preserved, and may be seen at
the Barber-Surgeons' Hall, Monkwell Street, London. Pepys pronounces
this "not a pleasant though a good picture." It is the largest and last
work of Holbein. The date assigned for its commencement was 1541, and it
was completed after the death of the artist in 1543. It is painted on
vertical oak boards, 5 ft. 11 in. high, and 10 ft. 2 in. long. It has
been slightly altered since it was delivered to the Barber-Surgeons. The
figures represent notable men belonging to the company and leaders of
the healing art of the period at which it was painted. [Illustration:

not a few disputes occurred between the barbers and the surgeons. The
following enactment was in force: "No person using any shaving or

matter, except of drawing teeth." Laws were made, but they could not, or
at all events were not, enforced. The barbers acted often as surgeons,
and the surgeons increased their income by the use of the razor and
shears. At this period, however, vigorous attempts were made to confine
each to his legitimate work. The Rev. J.L. Saywell has a note on
bleeding in his "History and Annals of Northallerton" (1885). "Towards
the early part of the nineteenth century," observes Mr Saywell, "a
singular custom prevailed in the town and neighbourhood o
