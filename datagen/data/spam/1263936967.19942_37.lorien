Dear Beneficiary,
 
I wish to introduce myself to you; I am Mr. Ismail El Sayed, a staffer of the National bank of Abu Dhabi
located in the United Arab Emirates. I am the bank’s Financial Auditor and In-charge of International Affairs as concerned with the NBAD.
 
During the financial auditing as at December 2007 done by me on all the accounts of the NBAD, I came across an Online Account, registered in your name and it contained some huge amount of money (amount undisclosed). And from the database records, this account has been Dormant, and since I am the only person privy to the bank’s database, I decided to study the account for a while, and till date you have not applied for the release of the funds.
 
As a good Muslim, this gave me some concern because according to laws guiding the banks in the U.A.E all funds dormant for more than one year without any mere agreement with the bank (i.e.) Have fixed deposit accounts or perhaps a Portfolio account, are been confiscated and the funds been sent to the U.A.E government for Amnesty purposes and I needed to let you know. Irrespective of the fact that the account happened to be in your name, I will like you to give me some information’s as regards the funds in question, so that I will be sure that am dealing with the true beneficiary of the funds, then, I can help you find an easy way to move out your funds. Meanwhile, I can only give you few details of the account as seen below;
 
Bank Name: National bank of Abu Dhabi
Account No: 0256659140
Swift code: NBADAEAAXXX
 
In this case, I want you to be honest with me and confirm the undisclosed amount to me, although the fund has accrued some interest over the period of deposit, thus, if the information you have given is confirmed, I will not hesitate to furnish you with the Account Login Details, so that you can check for yourself to see the existence of the account in question.
 
Further directives will be given to you as we proceed. I will also like you to furnish me with your full contact details.
 
Yours Faithfully,
 
Mr. Ismail El Sayed.
