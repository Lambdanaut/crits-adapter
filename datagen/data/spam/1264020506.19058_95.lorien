Good Day Sir/Madam,

How are you and your family? It might astonish you to read from me. I am Mr. George Adams, Liberian but Ghana residencial. I am a consultants on geo-science and mineral resources. Due to my position in the government, I was unable to go in to personal investment. There is a great opportunity for both of us and I want you to take advantage of this life-time opportunity.
The point is that there is a land in a remote village where we detected gold and as the Team Director on geo-science in my Department, I know the government does not have the facilities and interest in the Gold Mining. But what the Government and Mr. President did was to issue Licenses to Foreigners and Expatriates to this mining site. It may not be your area of specialization, before you venture into this project. I was made head of the committee who will confirm the licenses issued to the Expert rates. The other members of the board are political appointee who does not have any experience in Geo-science. What I want from you is to accept sponsorship. I will apply for this License on your behalf.
I will Register a company in your name so that the license can be given to you in your name. There are funds to start up the project and mining process, the source of the funds will be declared to you as soon as I hear from you. This does not take your time just accept the sponsorship. As a result of the nature of my job, I cannot apply for it as the government will prosecute me but you as a foreigner, they will accept your application. we shalll agree on your percentage.
I look forward to hear from you soon, Be advised to direct your response to my private Email [ adamsgeorge2010@gmail.com ] Do not forget to send me your Name, Address and Telephone numbers to enable us talk extensively on this note. Have a nice day.
Regards,
George Adams
