I am Mrs Joy Collins from Netherlands,I am 69 years old,i am deaf and
suffering from a long time cancer of the breast which also affected my
brain,from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it
is quite obvious that, according to my doctors they have advised me
that i may not live for the next one months,this is because the cancer stage

has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought up from a motherless
babies home was married to my late husband for twenty years without a
child ,died in a fatal motor accident Before his death we were true
Christians.

Since his death I decided not to re-marry,I sold all my inherited
belongings and deposited all the sum of $18.5million dollars with a
Security Company.Presently, this money is still with them and the
management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive
the money for keeping it so long or rather issue a letter of
authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not
come over because of my illness or they get it confisticated.
Presently, Im with my laptop in a hospital where I have been
undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk
and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.

It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any
organisation of your choice and distributed each year among the charity
organization,the poor and the motherless babies home where i come
from.I want you God fearing, to also use this money to fund churches,
orphanages and widows,I took this decision, before i rest in peace
because my time will soon be up.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
Security Company.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will
prove you as the new beneficiary of my fund. Please assure me that you
will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you
soon.

Waiting for your reply

Yours in Christ

Mrs Joy Collins
